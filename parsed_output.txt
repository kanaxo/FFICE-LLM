**1.1** **BACKGROUND**

1.1.1 The FF-ICE Concept document (Volume I of this Manual) was developed by the ATM

Requirements and Performance Panel (ATMRPP) to enable in part the realization of the
Global ATM Operational Concept and in doing so provide a mechanism to succeed the
present-day ICAO flight plan.

1.1.2 The necessary changes to Annexes 2, 11, 15 and PANS-ATM were also developed by the

ATMRPP to provide the provisions or framework within which FF-ICE should be
implemented.

**1.2** **PURPOSE**

1.2.1 This document has been created to provide the necessary assistance and information that

may be required by an ATM Service Provider or Aircraft Operator in implementing the
provisions related to FF-ICE in the pre-departure phase.

1.2.2 The FF-ICE provisions provide a high level description of the actions and responsibilities of

members of the ATM community when working within an FF-ICE environment. The
provisions describe ‘what’ should be done. This document is intended to answer the
question ‘how’.

1.2.3 FF-ICE is a new working environment and as such it is normal that in the absence of

experience some element of doubt or uncertainty will exist in terms of implementation
detail. As a result, some flexibility is required enabling corrections or modifications to the
guidance to be made in a timely manner. Early FF-ICE implementations will therefore
assist in developing this document further by obtaining the necessary experience and
proposing any changes that may be required.

1.2.4 This document is intended to be read by members of the ATM community who are

engaged or plan to engage in operations using the FF-ICE operational environment.

**1.3** **SCOPE**

1.3.1 This document addresses the first implementation release of FF-ICE. It is therefore

primarily concerned with pre-departure data and procedures. However, some data used
post-departure will be provided pre-departure.

1.3.2 The following operational concepts, as described in Volume I, have not yet been

addressed:

a) Operator Flight Priority — indication of the relative priority of a flight within an operator’s set

of flights (e.g., a fleet);

b) Operator Restrictions and Constraints — operator procedures and other operator-specific

information that may impact manoeuvers and clearances they are unable to accept from
ATC; c) Operator Preferences — preferences on operator procedures and other operator-specific

information impacting manoeuvers and clearances;

d) Movement Preferences — movement preferences submitted by flight planners for

consideration by traffic flow automation in the event that a traffic management initiative
becomes necessary;

e) Departure Surface Segment — the elements of the overall trajectory from the departure

gate up to and including the departure runway;

f) Airborne Trajectory Tolerances — the type and bound of tolerance applied to each of the

different dimensions;

g) Aircraft Intent — an unambiguous relationship to the trajectory of how the aircraft will

execute the trajectory;

h) Formation Characteristics — provides information describing the relationship requirements

and properties of formation flights;

i) Previous Flight GUFI — the identification of the arrival flight which will use the same

aircraft, when it is known;

j) Next Flight GUFI — identification of the departure flight which will use the same aircraft,

when it is known.

1.3.3 As FF-ICE is expected to be deployed within a SWIM operational environment (see section

2.4) the main procedures and processes are described in terms of services. This document
therefore introduces the different flight planning related services, as illustrated in Figure 1
and describes their use within the pre-departure phase of flight. 
No specific messages defined. Information on flights
that match a set of criteria are transmitted to
registered subscribers in response to certain events or
conditions. An eASP will indicate the events and/or
criteria to which a subscriber can subscribe.


Figure 1: FF-ICE Services

1.3.4 It should be noted that while the Flight Data Request Service is mandatory for an eASP to

provide, nothing prevents an operator from also providing a request service enabling an
eASP to request relevant information concerning a flight.

1.3.5 FF-ICE services are expected to be highly automated. The CDM processes that FF-ICE

services facilitate are expected to be performed via computer-to-computer links within a
SWIM-compatible environment. The human in the loop should not experience an increase
in workload as a result of FF-ICE implementation. Human intervention is only expected in
terms of decision making when, for example, it is decided that business objectives may be
better served by investigating or initiating, via the automation, a change. The frequency
with which human intervention may be required will vary from one participant to another
depending on the level of automation employed. See also section 2.4.  ## 2 IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS

**2.1** **IMPLEMENTATION DRIVERS**

2.1.1 ATM Capacity and Performance Objectives — the growth in air traffic over the years and

the need to achieve improved capacity and flight efficiency has given rise to the
development of ever more sophisticated ATM systems and processes within a
collaborative decision-making environment. This collaborative environment involves all
actors concerned with the operation of a flight, as reflected in the Global Air Traffic
Management Operation Concept (ICAO Doc. 9854) and in the Manual on Air Traffic
Management System Requirements (ICAO Doc. 9882). These documents envision the
need to exchange data which provides greater granularity and improved accuracy
concerning the expected flight trajectory and its associated constraints. The exchange of
such data will initially be used to enhance current procedures but will ultimately facilitate a
full trajectory-based mode of operation. The key needs include:

a) Functionality — the implementation of new functionality and procedures such as A
RNP, Airport CDM, flexible use of airspace (FUA), direct or free route airspace
(where adherence to specified routes, DCT segments and/or entry points may not be
required), trajectory-based operations (TBO) and advanced Air Traffic Flow
Management (ATFM) measures require the sharing of additional information through
new exchanges not able to be supported by the current ATS messages.

b) Extensibility — the existing ATS messages (e.g., FPL) have been shown to be

inadequate for providing the additional information needed. In 2012, some additional
capabilities were added to the existing flight plan, and the cost to implement was very
high. More importantly, the cost was incurred even for States that were not planning
to use the new capability. This model will not support the continued incremental
changes anticipated.

c) Capacity — the existing ATS messages that are exchanged via the Aeronautical

Fixed Telecommunication Network (AFTN) have limits as to the maximum message
size allowed. These limits have been propagated into limits on sizes of data elements
within the flight plan and other messages. Already creating issues, these limits
constrain the ability to keep adding information to the current messages.

d) Redundancy — as the implementation of FF-ICE becomes more widespread and

progress is made towards post departure coordination and TBO, the complexities
and costs associated with support for a mixed mode environment will become more
difficult, whilst cost and effort to implement FF-ICE should at the same time improve.

2.1.2 FF-ICE addresses two fundamental requirements:

a) The ability to exchange, between the operator and ATM, more flight and flow related

information in a systematic manner which is both robust and expandable facilitating
future requirements for both operator and ATM; b) The provision of a systematic collaboration or negotiation procedure between the

operator and ATM which facilitates the determination of an optimal route and
trajectory.

2.1.3 FF-ICE requires a basic set of capabilities, and then permits selection of various

advanced capabilities for implementation, so an operator or ASP can tailor to their
environment and needs. Although an ASP may elect to implement FF-ICE services
voluntarily as further explained in 2.4.1, for such an ASP the Filing and Flight Data
Request services are mandatory while the other services are optional. The decision
process is discussed further in sections 2.2 and 2.3 below.

2.1.4 The requirement expressed in 2.1.2 a) is expected to bring benefits for all operators and

ASPs both in terms of operations (exchange of more data allowing implementation of
improved functionalities) and in terms of costs related to system evolutions (robust and
expandable format). ASPs with high traffic demand and operators who fly within such
airspace would be expected to benefit the most and to be early in their deployment of FFICE. Those who operate in lower demand airspace where economic drivers may be less
critical at first will find a gradual change in the economic balance as the factors described
in b) become evident.

2.1.5 The provision of the Planning Service, as referred to in 2.1.2 b), is more beneficial in high

demand and/or high complexity airspace. Nevertheless, even in low complexity airspace
the ability for an operator to determine in advance that a proposed flight plan is
acceptable to an eASP is a valuable service that can improve data quality, particularly in
advance of an AIRAC cycle. In doing so it will also reduce the costs associated with any
manual intervention that might become necessary later, either during flight plan filing or
even later during flight execution.

**2.2** **OPERATOR DECISION TO IMPLEMENT FF-ICE**

2.2.1 FF-ICE allows for a number of services and processes to be provided. Operators will

have a choice to select which services, processes and data items will provide them
meaningful benefits, as well as which are available from eASPs. The primary services or
processes include:

a) Planning Service

      - with or without a re-evaluation process

b) Filing Service

      - with or without a re-evaluation process

c) Flight Data Request Service

d) Publication Service

e) Notification Service

f) Trial Service

**2.2.2 Planning Service** 2.2.2.1 The FF-ICE Planning Service permits an operator to submit information concerning the

intention to operate a flight (a Preliminary Flight Plan) for evaluation by the eASP.
Feedback is provided regarding restrictions and associated constraints that will be
applicable to the flight, and it allows for a collaborative, iterative planning process to
optimize the plan and reduce any surprises once a Filed Flight Plan is submitted.

2.2.2.2 An operator, having ascertained that the Planning Service will be available from the

relevant eASP(s), should evaluate the value of receiving the feedback on restrictions
and constraints and using it in their flight planning to optimize flights. They should also
consider the benefits of increasing the likelihood that flights will be cleared as filed due
to issues being worked out in the planning/feedback process. In general, the more
complex the airspace, the more value there will be to the Planning Service.

2.2.2.3 Operators are encouraged to submit a Preliminary Flight Plan that contains more

advanced information if relevant eASPs advertise that they will receive better
assessment of the flight plan when provided. The additional information may include:

     - Climb and descent performance data to allow more accurate and consistent
calculation of Trajectories by the eASP.

     - Operator-calculated Trajectory to allow understanding by the eASP of the operator
expectations.

2.2.2.4 The re-evaluation process, when implemented by an eASP, is part of the Planning and

Filing Service and provides, as a minimum, an indication of a change of status for a
flight plan with respect to that eASP. A more advanced re-evaluation process may
provide an indication of, for example, the addition or removal of a restriction or
constraint without impacting the status of the flight plan, see 3.5.7 for more details. As
restrictions, and any changes to them, are anyway published, operators should be
aware of the changes and should not need the “reminder” that the re-evaluation process
provides. However, not all operators have the ability to monitor the situation so closely.
In addition, the re-evaluation process provides the operator with systematic information
concerning the impact upon individual flight plans, as perceived by the eASP. This can
be very useful information even for those operators and/or flight plan service providers
with monitoring processes of their own.
It is also worth noting that the publication of information concerning restrictions is
expected to be achieved in a manner that enables an automated consumption of the
data (e.g., digital NOTAM).

**2.2.3 Filing Service**

2.2.3.1 FF-ICE will permit submission of a Filed Flight Plan using a standardised FF-ICE format

in lieu of the teletype-format FPL used today. FF-ICE also provides feedback to the
operator regarding whether the flight plan was successfully processed, and whether it is
acceptable to the eASP.

2.2.3.2 Any operator implementing FF-ICE must be able to submit a flight plan in FF-ICE format

containing at least the minimum required content which is equivalent to the information
provided in the existing FPL (PANS-ATM Appendix 2), with some improvements such
as richer set of capability information and a GUFI. For example, emerging Performance Based Navigation, Required Surveillance
Performance, and ADS-B applications will be consistently and more reliably represented
in the flight plan.

2.2.3.3 To improve operations by benefiting from the new data made available through the

Filing Service, Operators are encouraged to submit a Filed Flight Plan that contains
additional, more advanced information if relevant eASPs advertise that they will receive
better assessment of the flight plan when provided. The additional information may
include:

     - Climb and descent performance data to allow more accurate and consistent
calculation of Trajectories by the eASP.

     - Operator-calculated Trajectory to allow understanding by the eASP of the operator
expectations.

2.2.3.4 The advantages of the re-evaluation process, when implemented by an eASP (see

2.2.2.4) will apply to the Filing Service as well as the Planning Service.

2.2.3.5 It would be natural for the Operator to assess the cost/benefit within the local

environment or region(s) in which it operates.

**2.2.4 Flight Data Request Service**

2.2.4.1 FF-ICE will require an eASP to make available a query and reply service [1]. This service

can potentially be extended by the eASP to allow an operator to verify, for example, the
status of a flight previously submitted. While the normal FF-ICE exchanges would not
make this necessary, it could be useful in certain non-nominal situations where there is
uncertainty regarding the current status of a flight.

2.2.4.2 The decision for the operator to use the request service will depend on how relevant

eASPs implement such a service, and the nature of the service they provide.

2.2.4.3 An operator also has the option of providing a query and reply service enabling an

eASP to query the flight data. This may be useful in any situation in which the
information currently held by the eASP is limited or of uncertain quality, but particularly
useful in obtaining information which is only required on an ad hoc basis and/or is
typically only available shortly before departure.

**2.2.5 Notification Service**

2.2.5.1 The Notification Service (see section 7) is an optional service currently foreseen for the

notification of departure and arrival. However, it is anticipated that as FF-ICE develops
beyond pre-departure other events in the life cycle of a flight will be added.

1 PANS-ATM chapter 11 describes use of the RQP and RQS messages for an ATS Unit to request a flight plan or
specific information about a flight. 2.2.5.2 If the operator currently transmits DEP and/or ARR messages, by delegation of the

concerned ASPs, then discussions regarding use of the FF-ICE equivalent messages
should be evaluated so that an operator moving to FF-ICE would not have to use AFTN
for this purpose after exchanging all other information about the flight via FF-ICE.

**2.2.6 Trial Service**

2.2.6.1 The Trial Service allows an operator to submit a “what-if” type of request to ascertain

the acceptability/validity and possible ATM impact of a potential flight plan or the effects
of a change being considered, without either creating a flight plan or changing the
intended flight plan currently on file.

**2.2.7 Publication Service**

2.2.7.1 The Publication Service is an optional service that allows authorised subscribers (see

section 9.1.1) to receive information concerning flights that are relevant to their
operations in an efficient manner.

**2.3** **ASP DECISION TO IMPLEMENT FF-ICE**

2.3.1 FF-ICE allows for a number of services or processes to be provided. ASPs need to

decide which services and processes will provide meaningful benefits to operators and to
their ATM operation. They include:

a) Planning Service

      - with or without a re-evaluation process

b) Filing Service

      - with or without a re-evaluation process

c) Flight Data Request Service

d) Notification Service

e) Trial Service

f) Publication Service

**2.3.2 Planning Service**

2.3.2.1 The FF-ICE Planning Service permits an eASP to provide restrictions and constraints

applicable to a flight back to the operator, and obtain early flight intent information that
will aid in demand assessment and resource planning. This assists the operator in their
planning, and, overall, should reduce the workload in collaborative planning. The degree
of benefit is commensurate with the traffic levels and restrictions in the airspace; i.e. the
more congested the airspace the more valuable this service will be to the ATM service
provider.

2.3.2.2 To provide the Planning Service an eASP needs at a minimum to be able to determine

relevant restrictions and constraints applicable to a flight and feed them back to the
operator. Considerations include:       - The guidance expects that restrictions have been published, generally via

aeronautical information services, and in a manner that facilitates automated
processing. The eASP should be prepared to identify which published restrictions
are relevant to the flight.

      - It may not be cost beneficial to evaluate every possible restriction; the eASP

needs to decide what is feasible and cost beneficial to provide and be clear on
what information is provided.

2.3.2.3 The eASP must also decide whether and how to take advantage of more advanced

content provided by the operator. The decisions should be done through collaboration
with users, since it makes no sense if one party implements and the other does not. A
phased approach is also something to consider, where initial implementation processes
the basic plan and additional processing of enhanced information is added on
incrementally. This type of approach can allow maturation of each step before new
capabilities are added.

      - Climb and descent performance data to allow more accurate and consistent

calculation of Trajectories by the eASP. This data may be usable with relatively
minimal changes to existing algorithms (if performance data are already built in to
the calculations).

      - Operator-calculated Trajectory to allow understanding by the eASP of the

operator’s expectations. Incorporating operator trajectories into an ATM system is
a bigger step, but could allow a more consistent picture for decision makers on
both sides.

2.3.2.4 An eASP that supports Preliminary Flight Plans and provides feedback should also

provide a “re-evaluation” process, updating the feedback to reflect changes to the ATM
configuration, restrictions and constraints. The feedback provided by the eASP should
be timely enough for appropriate action to be taken by the operator. The advantage to
the eASP of providing such a service is an improvement in the quality of the flight plan
data held by the eASP.

**2.3.3 Filing Service**

2.3.3.1 FF-ICE will permit an eASP to receive Filed Flight Plans using a standardised FF-ICE

format in lieu of the teletype-format FPL used today. FF-ICE also allows the eASP to
automate feedback to the operator concerning its ability to process the flight plan
message and the resultant flight plan acceptability[2].

2.3.3.2 An eASP implementing FF-ICE must provide handling of the minimum required content

commensurate with the processing of an FPL today, with the addition of the

2 Flight Plan Acceptability is an assessment of a flight plan with regard to its compliance with established
criteria and applicable flight plan restrictions and constraints. requirements to provide a Submission Response and a Filing Status. The Submission
Response is relatively simple as it reflects the acceptance, or not, of the received
message. Provision of Filing Status implies potentially more processing in order to
evaluate the acceptability of the flight plan.

2.3.3.3 The eASP must also decide whether and how to take advantage of more advanced

content provided by the operator. The decision process is the same as that for the
Planning Service, see 2.3.2.3.

2.3.3.4 The advantages of the re-evaluation process (see 2.3.2.4) will apply to the Filing

Service as well as the Planning Service.

**2.3.4 Flight Data Request Service**

2.3.4.1 An eASP implementing FF-ICE must at a minimum support flight plan data requests that

replicate the function of the RQP and RQS messages and allow another eASP to
request an FF-ICE flight plan, or supplementary information about a flight in FF-ICE
format.

2.3.4.2 Optionally, the eASP can choose to allow queries of additional information, such as the

status of the flight or the applicable restrictions/constraints. Note that this capability is
meant for use with single flights and is not meant to serve as a general publication
service.

2.3.4.3 The eASP can also consider whether to provide the service to operators, with

appropriate controls regarding which flights may be accessed by a particular operator.

**2.3.5 Notification Service**

2.3.5.1 If currently receiving DEP and ARR messages from operators or other eASPs, these

stakeholders should be consulted to determine whether using the FF-ICE equivalents
would make sense (and allow all exchanges to be via FF-ICE rather than revert to AFTN
for DEP and ARR).

**2.3.6 Trial Service**

2.3.6.1 The Trial Service enables an operator to determine the acceptability/validity and

possible impact of a potential flight plan, or an alternative to an existing flight plan,
without actually creating or modifying a flight plan (Preliminary or Filed). The trial service
can therefore assist in ensuring the stability and relevance of information held within the
main ATM system. In addition its use by operators will improve the quality of information
submitted to the planning or filing service.

2.3.6.2 The Trial Service could also be used by an eASP to assess the impact upon a flight(s)

of a proposed change to the ATM configuration.

**2.3.7 Publication Service**

2.3.7.1 An eASP may optionally provide a Publication Service that enables subscribers (see

section 9.1.1) to obtain information about flights relevant to their operations. 2.3.7.2 An eASP can subscribe to the Publication Service(s) provided by other eASP(s),

typically those that generate most of its traffic. In doing so it can automatically obtain the
latest information concerning, for example, the route/trajectory of flights which are due
to enter its airspace.

**2.4** **IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY**

2.4.1 The implementation of flight and flow information for a collaborative environment (FF-ICE)

is a step change as air traffic management (ATM) stakeholders gear up towards the
global ATM vision. As it is a voluntary based implementation, subject to the needs and
requirements of the individual State or organisation, and to avoid a “big-bang” approach
previously employed during the transition to the current ICAO flight planning system (also
known as “FPL2012”), a phased approach to implementation is proposed to ensure a
smooth, harmonised transition towards FF-ICE.

2.4.2 The Implementation Strategy provided in APPENDIX I – FF-ICE Implementation Strategy

aims to guide ICAO, regions and States in planning the implementation of FF-ICE to
reduce any potential negative impact arising from mixed mode operations, as well as to
ensure a smooth, harmonised transition to FF-ICE globally.

**2.5** **INFORMATION MANAGEMENT**

**2.5.1 SWIM requirements and guidance**

2.5.1.1 The PANS-IM provides the generic SWIM requirements applicable to all information

domains, including the FF-ICE information domain. These requirements are organised
as follows: General requirements on SWIM (including Quality Management),
Governance, Information, Information Services, and Technical Infrastructure.

2.5.1.2 The Manual on SWIM Implementation (Doc 10039 Volume II) contains guidance for

information service providers and consumers implementing SWIM. This guidance is
applicable when implementing the information services used by the FF-ICE Services in
accordance with the PANS-IM requirements.

_Note: FF-ICE Services are defined as a function from a business perspective in a_
_consistent manner with the definition of other services in Annex 3 (MET service), 11 (Air_
_traffic services) and 15 (Aeronautical information services). In order to fulfil the part of the_
_function related to the exchange of information, FF-ICE Services make use of one or more_
_of information services, defined as “A type of service in a service-oriented architecture_
_that provides an ATM information sharing capability.”, in accordance with the PANS-IM_
_requirements._ 2.5.1.3 SWIM enablers[3] satisfying the PANS-IM requirements are available in order to support

the gradual implementation and use of the information services used by the FF-ICE
Services. More information on the SWIM enablers relevant to FF-ICE is provided in
sections 2.5.3, 2.5.4 and 2.5.5.

_Note: The experience and community knowledge gained while providing and consuming_
_the information services used by the FF-ICE Services may lead to concrete improvements_
_to these enablers, or may lead to the creation of additional enablers, as appropriate._

**2.5.2 Quality management for FF-ICE**

2.5.2.1 Doc 10039 Volume II provides guidance on the establishment of a Quality Management

System for achieving the required quality of information and quality of information
services used by the FF-ICE Services.

2.5.2.2 Appendix C of Doc 9965 Volume II specifies the requirements on the quality of

Information exchanged by FF-ICE Services in terms of data completeness, by
identifying those data elements which are mandatory in each FF-ICE Message.

2.5.2.3 The PANS-IM specifies requirements on the provision of information about Quality of

Service as part of the Information Service Overview. Guidance on how to satisfy these
requirements is provided in Doc 10039 Volume II Chapter 5.

2.5.2.4 For FF-ICE, information about Quality of Service is expected to cover, among others,

a) Performance considerations, such as the volume of FF-ICE messages that will be

supported. A service provider should ensure that a single user is unable to
monopolise a service or to degrade it below agreed service levels for other users.

b) Reliability considerations. It should be noted that for the FF-ICE Services provided

by eASPs such as the FF-ICE Planning and Filing Services, the reliability
requirements will depend on a number of factors that can vary by eASP, so each
ASP implementing FF-ICE should assess their situation. Examples of relevant
factors include:

       - The number of flights per hour handled;

       - The backup strategy to be employed — for example, will the service have
completely redundant computer systems or will it revert to more basic support
such as filing an FPL over AFTN or verbally coordinating FPL content?

       - The number of flights likely to be delayed significantly by a loss of the service.

3 SWIM enablers are resources that FF-ICE Participants can practically implement or use, such as FIXM.
The Manual on SWIM Implementation provides a list of SWIM enablers that address various aspects of
interoperability in accordance with the SWIM concept components. Likewise, the reliability requirements for Flight Data Request Services provided by
eAUs (see chapter 2.2.4.3) may vary by eAU, so each eAU should equally assess
their situation. Examples of relevant factors include:

       - The number of own flights per hour;

       - The backup strategy to be employed.

2.5.2.5 An implementer could consider separate Quality of Service requirements and strategies

for the different FF-ICE Services. For instance, the Planning & Trial Services could
implement less stringent Quality of Service requirements compared to e.g. the Filing &
Notification Services.

**2.5.3 Exchanged Information**

2.5.3.1 The implementation of SWIM entails service orientation and business process modelling

to identify information exchange requirements leading to the definition of information
services. Doc 9965 Volume II (this document) specifies the common procedures and
processes that organizations participating in FF-ICE will implement to achieve integrated
business processes. Consequently, the FF-ICE Services described in Doc 9965 Volume
II are the result of a collaborative analysis of the processes and information exchanges
involved in FF-ICE operations.

2.5.3.2 The Information Exchange Requirements for FF-ICE are specified in Appendix B and

Appendix C of Doc 9965 Volume II. Appendix C provides the description of the FF-ICE
Messages exchanged by the information services used by the FF-ICE Services,
including the business rules addressing the presence of fields in each message.
Appendix B provides the data convention that applies to the constituent fields of the FFICE Messages.

2.5.3.3 Whilst Doc 9965 Volume II remains applicable for global FF-ICE harmonisation, the

Information exchanged by FF-ICE Services may be supplemented to address local or
regional supplementary procedures, as appropriate.

2.5.3.4 Appendix B and Appendix C of Doc 9965 Volume II also cover the PANS-IM

requirements on the collection of metadata on information. These appendixes include
requirements on “Message Information”, i.e. requirements on metadata for the FF-ICE
Messages. “Message Information” covers, for instance: Identifier the FF-ICE Message,
Type of FF-ICE Message, Originator of the FF-ICE Message, Sending time of the FFICE Message, Operator Flight Plan Version (for some FF-ICE Messages only), etc.

2.5.3.5 Chapter 3.8 provides additional guidance on how to use some of these metadata fields

in order to manage versioning of, and referencing to, the information exchanged by FF ICE Services.

2.5.3.6 FIXM, the Flight Information Exchange Model, is an information exchange model

capturing Flight and Flow information that is globally standardised. FIXM is the recommended domain specific Information Exchange Model for implementing FF-ICE
information exchanges in accordance with the PANS-IM requirements on information[4].

2.5.3.7 FIXM comprises ‘FIXM Core’ that provides harmonised flight data structures and the

FIXM ‘FF-ICE Message’ Application that builds on FIXM core and that provides the
individual FF-ICE message templates, i.e. the individual exchange schemas for the FFICE Messages. Altogether, these FIXM components satisfy the information exchange
requirements for FF-ICE described in chapter 2.5.3.2 and the requirements on Metadata
for FF-ICE described in chapter 2.5.3.4.

2.5.3.8 FIXM implements an extension mechanism that can be used to support local or regional

supplements to the Information exchanged by FF-ICE Services, as explained in chapter
2.5.3.3.

2.5.3.9 The website www.FIXM.aero is the authoritative source for downloading FIXM. The

website also includes information about the applicable FIXM change management
process and FIXM community membership rules, and the link to the FIXM User Manual
which captures community knowledge and recommended practices about the
implementation of FIXM and its further evolution.

2.5.4 **Information Services used by the FF-ICE Services**

2.5.4.1 Information Service Overviews capturing metadata about the information services used

by the FF-ICE Services need to be provided in order to enable FF-ICE Participants to
discover the information services being provided and to assess their fitness for purpose.

2.5.4.2 The PANS-IM lists the constituent fields of Information Service Overviews. Doc 10039

Volume II Chapter 5 provides general guidance for the completion of Information
Service Overviews. FF-ICE-specific guidance on the development of Overviews for the
information services used by the FF-ICE Services is provided hereafter:

     - For fields ‘Information service name’, ‘Brief description of the service’ and ‘Information

service function’, consider leveraging the description of the individual FF-ICE Services
from Doc 9965 Volume II, as appropriate.

     - For field ‘Information category’, specify Flight information; Capacity, demand and flow

_information._

    - For field ‘Information Exchange Models’, specify FIXM “FF-ICE Message” Application

_[version] (if this SWIM enabler is used). Also indicate the name of any extension(s) to_
FIXM used by the service, if applicable.

_Note: the FIXM “FF-ICE Message” Application is explicitly mentioned here as it_
_provides the recommended exchange schemas for the FF-ICE Messages and ensures_

4 When a particular implementation of FF-ICE is not based on the use of FIXM, the alignment with the
AIRM is recommended and the exchange schema must be standardized. See Doc 10039 Volume II
Chapter 4 for more information. _common understanding of the FF-ICE exchange schemas used._

     - For the other fields, refer to the guidance provided by Doc 10039 Volume II Chapter 5.

2.5.4.3 Information where to retrieve the Overviews of the information services used by the FF
ICE Services needs to be published in the State AIP, as further explained in chapter
2.10.2.

2.5.4.4 SWIM Service Registries can be used for publishing the Overviews of the information

services used by the FF-ICE Services. SWIM Service Registries enable providers of FFICE Services to publicize the related information services and enable consumers to
discover the operational information services that are available for consumption, or that
will be available for consumption at a certain date, and to plan the consumption of these
services accordingly.

2.5.4.5 SWIM Service Registries provide details about the geographic coverage of the

information provided by the registered services, therefore helping FF-ICE Participants
select the services being relevant to their areas of interest.

### Note: An FF-ICE Participant may have to query several SWIM Service Registries in order to get an exhaustive list of available information services being relevant to its area of interest.

 Note 2: Examples of operational SWIM Service Registries are:

 • European SWIM Registry: https://eur-registry.swim.aero/home

 • US NAS Service Registry/Repository: https://nsrr.faa.gov/

 • ...

**2.5.5 Technical Infrastructure used by FF-ICE**

2.5.5.1 The interface bindings to be used for implementing the information services used by the

FF-ICE Services need to conform to the requirements on interface bindings of the
PANS-IM Chapter 6.

2.5.5.2 During the early implementation phase of FF-ICE/R1, there is no additional FF-ICE

requirement on the selection of interface bindings beyond the applicable technical
infrastructure requirements from the PANS-IM. This allows the selection of interface
bindings that are best suited to the implementation context, taking into account possible
regional or local SWIM and/or FF-ICE requirements.

_Note: FF-ICE Messages are agnostic to the selected interface and network bindings and_
_are therefore not affected by this selection._

2.5.5.3 Doc 10039 Volume II Chapter 6 provides examples of consolidated, and commonly

defined and agreed upon, SWIM TI interface bindings that can be used for implementing
the information services used by the FF-ICE Services.

**2.5.6 Governance for FF-ICE** 2.5.6.1 Fostering collaboration between FF-ICE Participants is important:

    - To ensure harmonised implementation of the FF-ICE procedures;

    - To agree on a harmonised technical representation of the FF-ICE Messages and

associated flight data structures exchanged by the information services used by the
FF-ICE Services;

    - To establish synergies, share information service implementation experience, and

agree on common information service implementation practices, as appropriate;

    - To address specific regional FF-ICE arrangements and implementation

considerations, as needed.

2.5.6.2 Doc 10039 Volume II Chapter 3 provides general guidance for facilitating the

implementation of information services and ensuring interoperability in a collaborative
manner.

**2.6** **COMMUNICATION INFRASTRUCTURE FOR FF-ICE**

**2.6.1 IP-based networks for FF-ICE**

2.6.1.1 Through SWIM, FF-ICE leverages IP-based communication infrastructures, in line with

the PANS-IM, Chapter 6. Therefore, the information services used by the FF-ICE Services
can be provided via IP-based networks, such as Internet or ATN/IPS TCP/IP-based
network.

2.6.1.2 Network performance and capability considerations including, security, availability,

incident detection, etc. are important when choosing the IP-based network over which to
provide the information services used by the FF-ICE Services.

**2.6.2 Role of AMHS in support of FF-ICE**

2.6.2.1 FF-ICE/R1 is the first step towards full FF-ICE deployment and initiates the transition to

the new types of information exchanges required by TBO and enabled by SWIM. ASPs
and operators are expected to implement FF-ICE Services on a needs basis, via cost
benefit analysis or as may be prescribed by local or regional regulations. The future
releases of FF-ICE will be entirely enabled by SWIM.

2.6.2.2 AMHS is technically able to transmit XML-based messages. However, the ability of

AMHS to support some Message Exchange Patterns (MEP) natively supported by the
SWIM Technical Infrastructure such as the Publish/Subscribe MEP (that some
information services used by some FF-ICE Services implement) has not been
demonstrated.

2.6.2.3 States considering the use of AMHS for FF-ICE/R1 information exchanges should

consider the following aspects:

    - Their local status of deployment of AMHS and transition plan towards SWIM; _Note: For instance, a State having no AMHS capability could opt for a direct_
_introduction to SWIM, as further explained in Doc 10039 Volume II Chapter 7 (SWIM_
_Uptake cases)._

    - Any applicable requirements or regulations at local or regional levels that may

complement global requirements for SWIM, and/or that may steer their implementation
of FF-ICE Services;

     - The availability of technical studies demonstrating the feasibility of using AMHS in

support of FF-ICE/R1 exchanges. Such technical studies should include demonstrating
the exchanges via the Publish/Subscribe MEP;

_Note: Doc 10039 Volume II Chapter 7 elaborates on the SWIM - AMHS bridges._

     - If this technical feasibility is demonstrated, a cost benefit analysis covering, among

others, the costs of the required AMHS evolution to meet the FF-ICE requirements,
and the costs of deferring the evolution to the new interface bindings of the SWIM
Technical Infrastructure required by the future releases of FF-ICE.

**2.7** **MIXED MODE ENVIRONMENT DURING TRANSITION**

**2.7.1 Overview**

2.7.1.1 When migrating from the current environment, using the ATS message format as

defined in PANS-ATM Appendix 3 (FPL, CHG, etc.), to the FF-ICE environment using
services, actors will operate within a “mixed mode” environment; i.e. one in which both
current ATS messages and their associated procedures will apply, in addition to FF-ICE
messages and associated procedures.

**2.7.2 Information distribution in a mixed-mode environment**

2.7.2.1 FF-ICE participants operating in a mixed-mode environment still have to ensure the

information that is operationally required is distributed appropriately. This implies
appropriate management of the information distribution.

2.7.2.2 For example, an eAU operating in a mixed mode environment would need to manage its

flight plan information distribution in order to ensure:

     - the relevant eASPs duly receive the required filed flight plan information, exchanged

using FF-ICE services (eFPL);

     - the relevant aASPs duly receive the required filed flight plan information, exchanged

via aeronautical fixed services (FPL);

    - an eFPL and an FPL are not submitted to the same eASP.

_Note: A coordinated migration to FF-ICE is preferable to keep the mixed-mode_
_environment duration to a minimum to limit the burden of having to support two formats_
_for the eAU and the eASP._ 2.7.2.3 The information distribution in a mixed-mode environment may be supported by bridges,

as appropriate. For instance, an eASP providing the 'translate and delivery' process
would act as a bridge facilitating the distribution of flight plan information.

2.7.2.4 Doc 10039 Volume II Chapter 7 provides further guidance about the transition to

information services and in particular about the information distribution in a mixed-mode
environment.

**2.7.3 Limiting the mix of message formats for the same flight**

2.7.3.1 The coexistence of traditional movement messages exchanges and FF-ICE Services in

a mixed-mode environment may imply that for the same flight, relevant information is
received both as ATS messages and as FF-ICE Messages. Given that operators will
have different capabilities, the reception by an eASP of both formats is inevitable.

2.7.3.2 The submission of different format messages to the same eASP(s) for the same flight

should be avoided whenever possible. If an eAU is not performing direct distribution and
has been obliged to submit a FPL via the departure ASP then subsequent messages
should also be submitted in the same way using ATS message format. Therefore the
reception of different format messages for the same flight should not normally happen
when the messages are being originated via the operator’s flight planning system.
However, under certain circumstances (e.g. when the subsequent messages are being
originated by a remote operator site), it may occur for an eFPL to be updated by ATS
messages.

2.7.3.3 Mixed mode operations and the consequences outlined above mean that the

capabilities of the different participants, particularly the Operator whose capabilities are
not published, cannot be assumed on the basis of the message format. While the
response to an individual message may be via the same format/communication channel
it is nevertheless important for participants to know which set of provisions, and
therefore procedures, are being applied. The tools introduced in mixed mode, therefore,
should be specifically designed to promote user awareness of the procedures and
information context for each message.

2.7.3.4 An operator that chooses to use FF-ICE services, through the submission of Preliminary

(PFP) and/or Filed (eFPL) Flight Plans, is capable of using the corresponding
information services, such as the reception and use of the appropriate response
messages, provided by the eASPs.

2.7.3.5 While an individual operator having transitioned to FF-ICE and operating entirely within

airspace where FF-ICE is supported may be able to remove its ability to support the
current ATS messages, an eASP will not. For a significant period of time it will be
incumbent upon eASPs to ensure their ability to work with both formats (see Appendix I
_for expected FPL2012 sunset date)._

**2.7.4 eASP interfaces with legacy systems**

2.7.4.1 An eASP will need to consider interfaces with its neighbours. As FF-ICE/R1 concerns

pre-departure, the use of FF-ICE for post-departure coordination has not yet been
developed. It is therefore assumed that existing arrangements will continue to exist and will require the relevant FF-ICE data items to ensure legacy information exchanges can
occur.

**2.7.5 Specific guidance on additional FPL information**

2.7.5.1 During the transition period, ICAO’s assessment of new flight plan information needs will

be based on:

    - the operational requirements on a global level (i.e. How are ATS personnel or

automation systems expected to interact with the information),

     - the necessity to address a short-term critical safety risk, and

     - the principle that amendments do not generate unjustifiable financial impact on ANSPs

and operators.

No changes would be introduced to the existing FPL fields unless they meet the three
criteria above. However, certain capabilities that have clear and urgent operational needs
may be required by the appropriate ATS authority in the free text fields of Item 18 (e.g.,
NAV/, SUR/), as this is assumed to be done without major financial impact.

The appropriate ATS authority, when prescribing new capabilities as a flight planning
requirement for provision of ATS, must select the appropriate code as provided in
paragraph 2.7.5.2. These codes are recommended to support global implementation and
alignment in order to reduce possible conflicting use.

_Note: the codes are developed by ICAO based on the following principles:_

_1) capabilities should be 2 characters of the letter-digit form_
_2) capabilities should be concatenated with/without spaces_
_3) no need for the use of a prefix_
_4) order of codes should never matter_

**2.8** **SUPPORTING SYSTEMS / SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS**

**2.8.1 Computer System/Software**

2.8.1.1 The original ATS FPL message was designed for a network of teletypes, and messages

were consequently short and capable of being handled manually if necessary. In
contrast, the processing of FF-ICE messages is expected to be automated; direct
manual handling or editing of an FF-ICE message will not be possible due to the length
and complexity of the data expected.

2.8.1.2 An FF-ICE participant should expect to have a flight planning system or flight data

processing system that can process the FF-ICE exchanges in a service-oriented

restrictions/constraints are necessary features of the software.

2.8.1.3 Compared to today, flight plan construction will use more information that is provided by

a computer and database than is provided directly by a person. For example, trajectory
information will be automatically generated based on calculations done by the flight
planning system. Note that today’s flight planning systems generally have most or all of
the information required. Generating the content for an FF-ICE flight plan is expected to
be more a composition of the FF-ICE message from existing information rather than
generation of new information.

**2.8.2 Flight Planning Support Tools**

2.8.2.1 As noted in para 2.8.1.1 above, FF-ICE exchanges are not directly “human

consumable”. The titles used within this document to name the individual data elements,
as described in Appendix B, may never be seen by a human. Therefore, an essential
part of any FF-ICE implementation will be the User Interface through which operational
personnel will work with the flight plan.

2.8.2.2 Note that even today, most flight plans are entered using a human-computer interface

that assists or automates significant portions of the form, for example:

a) The system may suggest one or more routes based on operator preferences or

observation of routes being commonly filed and approved;

b) Aircraft information, equipment and capabilities, operator identification and other

standard information can be stored and automatically inserted by the system; and

c) Automated forms can include drop-down lists, check boxes, and explanatory text

that simplify entries and remove the need to memorize or look up obtuse codes.

2.8.2.3 FF-ICE should ideally require little if any additional information from the operator or

dispatcher, with automation able to supply the information. The user interface does not
need to be vastly different from today; all of the existing information in the f light plan is
still used.

**2.9** **OTHER INTEROPERABILITY ASPECTS**

2.9.1 FF-ICE and TBO brings the domains of ATM, airport and aircraft operations ever closer in

terms of data exchanges and related information needs and standards. This implies that
interoperability between these domains has to be managed appropriately, for the subjects
that are cross-cutting.

2.9.2 As explained in chapter Doc 10039 Volume II Appendix A, interoperability has many

aspects and can be addressed at organisational, information and technical levels,
depending on the needs. Various activities may be therefore envisaged in order to align
practices, vocabularies and technical enablers between these domains, or to establish or
facilitate appropriate correlations whenever required by the operations. 2.9.3 For instance, it could be envisaged to align or to establish correspondences between

overlapping vocabularies used in ATM and in aircraft operations. As an example, the
ATM notion of Flight corresponds to what aircraft operations call a 'Flight Leg'. Or, in
other terms, from an aircraft operations' perspective, a given flight is a series of 'ATM'
flights.

2.9.4 Facilitating the correlation between aircraft & flight identifiers is another example of

activity that could be envisaged. The ATC aircraft identifier as provided in the flight plan
(ICAO) is different from the operator commercial flight identifier (IATA). This difference is
exacerbated by the increasing need to prevent callsign similarity confusion which can
result in an ATC flight plan identifier which is significantly different to the commercial
identifier which is commonly used in operator and airport related exchanges.

2.9.5 There is a practical need to facilitate interoperability between information exchanged via

FF-ICE and related IATA information as may be exchanged, for example, via AIDX. FFICE related data exchanges should therefore facilitate interoperability between the
different domains by including the ability, where necessary, to add the IATA
representation of relevant information.

2.9.6 FF-ICE strives to enable these correlations by including the ability, where necessary, to

add the IATA representation of relevant information. In particular:

     - The FF-ICE data definitions provided in Appendix B includes the ability to indicate the

IATA code for an aerodrome.

    - The Preliminary and Filed Flight Plan messages as described in Appendix C include

the ability to provide the IATA operator code and commercial flight identifier (described
in B-2.6.2).

2.9.7 It is important to note that the ability to include the IATA representation of the data is

optional and does not replace the standard ICAO representation of the data which
remains mandatory, as do the procedures for providing alternative information when, for
example, an aerodrome doesn’t have an ICAO identifier.

**2.10 IMPACT OF THE FF-ICE IMPLEMENTATION**

**2.10.1 Regulatory Authority Perspective**

2.10.1.1 A State regulatory authority will need to consider the impact that the introduction of FF 
ICE may have under the three areas of interest mentioned below. In doing so it should
also take into account the impact of a mixed mode transitional period.

a) Licensing — the introduction of FF-ICE and related procedures into ATM, particularly

the use and exchange of trajectory information, may impact personnel training (see
2.9) and related licensing procedures;

b) Certification — ATM systems and related procedures will require modifications to

address the introduction of FF-ICE. The certification process may need to be
adapted to include the introduction of FF-ICE; c) Publications — a State authority which is responsible for the production or oversight

of state related publications such as the AIP will need to make the necessary
changes.

**2.10.2 State Publications impact**

**Publishing available FF-ICE Services**

2.10.2.1 A State implementing FF-ICE will need to publish the necessary information an operator

requires in order to determine the services, procedures and processes
available/applicable within the State as a whole and/or the various airspace(s) and
aerodromes for which the State is responsible.

2.10.2.2 To do so, a State will need to publish, within its AIP, the services and processes it

provides and the necessary details to enable an operator to make use of the service.
The following list illustrates the types of services and processes that may be provided:

a) the provision of FF-ICE mandatory services (Filing and Flight Data Request)

b) the provision of Planning Service

c) the provision of Trial Service

d) the provision of Publication Service

e) the provision of Notification Service

f) the provision of translation and delivery process

g) the provision of forwarding process

h) the provision of re-evaluation process

2.10.2.3 For each of the services referred to above the State responsible will need to provide the

location of the corresponding Information Service Overviews (see 2.5.4.2). This location
is expressed as a URL which will be either:

    - The URL of the SWIM Service Registry (see 2.5.4.3) that would contain the Overviews

of the information services used by the FF-ICE Services. When a region uses a
common SWIM Service Registry, the URL of that common SWIM Service Registry
shall be added to each State AIP participating in the concerned region; or

    - The URL of the web site that would provide access to the Information Service

Overviews.

**Publishing supporting ATM information**

2.10.2.4 The use of trajectory information by operators and ASPs introduces a higher level of

fidelity in terms of the information that can be exchanged and the detail that can be
represented. If operators and ASPs are to succeed in reaching a common view of the
trajectory, it is essential that the basic data concerning the ATM configuration (routes,
navigation aids, airport data, etc.) as well as flight planning restrictions related to ATFM
or airspace management processes are published by the relevant authority. 2.10.2.5 A state should ensure that this information is made available and can be used

appropriately to enable the FF-ICE operations and related information exchanges.

2.10.2.6 The State AIPs and/or regional supplementary procedures should be used to either

provide the necessary information or to indicate how and where the information can be
obtained, as appropriate. As the SWIM uptake expands, this information is expected to
be consumed from information services.

**2.10.3 Training impact**

**General**

2.10.3.1 The introduction of FF-ICE Planning is not expected to change the roles and

responsibilities of either the airspace user or the ASP. It is however expected to impact
the tools and procedures to be used in performing their roles and responsibilities. An
assessment should therefore be made of the changes to tools and procedures currently
in use and relevant training introduced as required. This assessment and resulting
training should include the actors’ awareness of the context of information related to an
individual flight.

2.10.3.2 Since most of the first phase of FF-ICE implementation concerns pre-departure, it is

envisaged that training needs for staff will focus on flight preparation, flight dispatch and
of course flight planning tasks.

2.10.3.3 Those staff that deal with flight plan information in the post departure phase will only

require basic understanding of FF-ICE Planning. It is envisaged that automation will
either translate advanced plan information back into the traditional flight plan format to
support legacy users, or take care of flight plan processing once a flight plan has left the
planning stage. Until FF-ICE implementation moves to the point where automation both
on the ground and in the cockpit supports real-time modification of trajectories, it is
important that flight plan information remains readable and understandable by human
operators.

**Aircraft Operator**

2.10.3.4 Aircraft operators and personnel responsible for flight planning will require significant

training to become familiar with the new procedures and services. While these new FFICE services and procedures are intended to be performed primarily by the automation,
personnel will need to be familiar with the new operational environment, i.e. the services
being used by the automation, and how it can be used to improve their operations and
advance their decision making processes.

2.10.3.5 Where applicable, the use of trajectories negotiation and its relationship with the

standard, Field 15 type, route description will be important for operators to understand.

2.10.3.6 In addition to the new procedures related to FF-ICE, operators and particularly flight

planning personnel will need to understand the impact of operating within a mixed mode
environment. As ASPs will make the transition to FF-ICE at varying points in time,
dispatchers and other airline FOC staff will have to interact with both concepts. 2.10.3.7 Flight crew need to be aware of the environment in which they are operating and how

the process of interacting with ATC may be affected by this. They also need to remain
proficient and be provided recurrent training in dealing with legacy providers.

**ATM Service Provider**

2.10.3.8 AIS staff will require transition training once their ASP decides to introduce FF-ICE.

Since eASP also support legacy flight plans, AIS staff of such eASPs need to remain
proficient in the legacy system until that system is completely phased out.

2.10.3.9 Flight Data Specialists supporting Air Traffic Controllers in FF-ICE Planning enabled

ATS facilities will require training to understand and process the advanced flight plan
information available through FF-ICE Planning and how to interface with neighbouring
ASPs that have not transitioned to FF-ICE.

2.10.3.10 Air Traffic Controllers in FF-ICE Planning enabled ATS facilities require

training to make use of the additional information provided by enabled airspace users,
and understand the limitations of dealing with non-enabled flights and neighbouring
units that have not transitioned to FF-ICE.

2.10.3.11 Personnel engaged in ATM related resource management will need to

understand the potential use/impact of the Planning Service, the Preliminary Flight Plan
and trajectory information and how this enhanced and improved data can be used within
their respective processes.

**2.11 AIR TRAFFIC FLOW AND CAPACITY MANAGEMENT**

2.11.1 Capacity management is based on the principle of adapting the ATM capacity to fit the

traffic demand. Only when this procedure is still unable to satisfy the complete demand
will flow or traffic management measures be required. Capacity management is achieved
primarily through the dynamic modification of ATC sectorisation or the assignment of
military airspace reservations in such a way that they facilitate the traffic demand, and
therefore more efficient flight trajectories, i.e. the Flexible Use of Airspace (FUA)
procedure. Most strategic ATM planning is performed using historical data and/or airline
scheduled information with limited or no route/trajectory information. The Planning
Service bridges the gap between medium/long-term ATM planning, based on flight
schedules and/or historical traffic data, and short-term planning based on filed flight
plans. Effective ATM capacity planning and management requires early knowledge of the
“underlying” demand; that is, the demand that would exist without “interference” due to
daily variations in airspace availability and ATFM measures. These interferences are
tools used by ASM/ATFM to provide needed capacity or to keep demand to within the
available capacity. It therefore makes no sense if the first indications of the demand, early
flight plans, are already adapted to take account of daily ATM measures and thereby
distort the underlying demand picture. To provide benefit, the first route/trajectory for a
flight must therefore be provided early enough to enable the resource planning activities
associated with ASM, ATFM and airport planning to be effective. In practise this means
the first route/trajectory for a flight should be provided in advance of the publication of
daily airspace availability and ATFM measures. 2.11.2 The process should become self-enhancing, meaning that as more operators engage in

early Planning confidence in the accuracy of the anticipated traffic demand will improve.
This improved predictability will reduce the need, and/or the impact, of an applied ATM
restriction. The process, once established, will make planning less reactionary allowing a
more stable situation to be developed earlier and earlier publication of any necessary
restrictions and their impact. This is in contrast to the situation where late engagement by
the operator is encouraged because only then are the restrictions and their constraints
known – a self-deprecating process.

2.11.3 The manner in which ATFM procedures are executed today, in particular the interface

with the operator, can differ significantly from one ASP to another. Work is on-going to
develop a global approach to the exchange of ATFM related information through FF-ICE.
Implementation of FF-ICE Planning and Filing Services does however include the ability
to make reference to an applicable published restriction in the feedback provided by an
eASP to the operator. In addition, the ability to represent the impact of an ATFM
restriction in the form of a route/trajectory constraint such as a flight level constraint, time
constraint, etc. is also included. ## 3 GENERAL PROCEDURES

**3.1** **MESSAGE SUBMISSION**

3.1.1 “Submission” is understood for the purpose of this manual as the procedure to be

followed by an operator when providing flight plan data and associated messages to
ATM.

3.1.2 This manual provides guidance with respect to FF-ICE procedures. An operator that is

unable to submit FF-ICE flight plan data shall continue to submit flight plans (FPL) and
associated ATS messages (CHG, DLA, etc.) in accordance with the procedures
described in PANS-ATM chapter 4.4 and Appendices 2 & 3. ASPs that have implemented
FF-ICE (eASPs) are obliged to continue their support of FPL and associated messages
as long as the mixed-mode environment exists.

3.1.3 An important feature of FF-ICE is its facilitation of CDM processes between the operator

and ATM services. FF-ICE therefore supports and encourages the direct submission, see
Figure 3, by the operator (or its designated representative) of flight plan data to the
relevant ASPs.

3.1.4 The recipients of the Preliminary Flight Plan may be different to those of the Filed Flight

Plan. As described in sections 4 and 6 respectively, the Preliminary Flight Plan can only
be provided to eASPs that provide a Planning Service and will be of interest only to
planning and resource management functions such as ATFM and ASM, not to ATC. The
Filed Flight Plan however must also be provided to ATC functions, both FF-ICE capable
(eASPs) as an eFPL, and non-FF-ICE capable (aASPs) as an FPL.

3.1.5 In a mixed mode environment it is necessary to ensure that aASPs are not unduly

impacted by the introduction of FF-ICE. The procedure for the submission of an
ICAO2012 flight plan (FPL) and the possibility for the operator or its representative to file
direct, is determined by the ATS unit responsible for the departure aerodrome. This
needs to be taken this into account, as described in 3.3, when an FF-ICE capable aircraft
operator departs from an aerodrome where the ATS unit is not FF-ICE capable.

3.1.6 It should be noted that today there can be national or even regional arrangements that

affect how messages should be either submitted and/or addressed; i.e. not every ATS
unit within a FIR or even every FIR within a region may need to be individually addressed.
These arrangements may also exist in an FF-ICE environment. In this case, guidance
specific to FF-ICE flight plan data should be published in the relevant AIP(s) and/or
regional supplementary procedures, as is done today for FPL.

3.1.7 In a mixed mode environment where one or more relevant ASPs are unable to process

FF-ICE data (aASP), it is incumbent upon the operator to ensure they are provided with
the appropriate ATS messages (FPL, CHG, etc.) as necessary and in accordance with
the applicable procedure, as described in 3.3. 3.1.8 It is likely that many flight planning service providers, having implemented FF-ICE

capabilities, will also retain the ability to generate the flight plan, and any subsequent
update messages, as ATS messages (FPL, CHG, etc.), as required.

3.1.9 An eASP may also choose to provide a forwarding facility where, upon request of the

flight plan originator, the received FF-ICE flight plan will be delivered in the appropriate
format to all relevant ASPs as indicated by the originator, thereby enabling an operator to
submit its eFPL to a single eASP. An eASP that chooses to provide such a service must
also forward the resultant response messages received from the relevant eASPs to the
flight plan originator that submitted the flight plan.

3.1.10 It is also possible that an eASP may, in addition to its own internal distribution of flight

data, provide a translation and delivery process where, upon request of the flight plan
originator, the received FF-ICE flight plan information will be translated by the eASP into
the appropriate ATS message(s) and distributed to the aASP recipients indicated by the
originator. The relevant eASPs will receive the FF-ICE flight plan directly from the flight
plan originator.

3.1.11 When the facility identified in 3.1.9 and/or 3.1.10 is provided by an eASP, the enlisting of

the service and necessary details should be published via the appropriate national or
regional documentation, as appropriate.

3.1.12 It is of particular importance that the flight plan and any subsequent flight planning

messages for the flight are submitted using the same procedure. If a translation and
delivery process or a forwarding process is used for the submission of the flight plan to
aASPs then subsequent flight planning messages should be submitted in the same way,
using the same service. Failure to adhere to this guidance could result in the reception by
an aASP of duplicate messages from different originator addresses.

3.1.13 The operator needs to ensure that the necessary information described in Appendix C is

provided in each FF-ICE message. In particular, if the operator is using one of the
services of an eASP identified in 3.1.9 or 3.1.10 the following information needs to be
provided:

a) an indication of the eASP being requested to perform the required translation and

delivery of the flight plan information to the relevant aASPs provided.

b) the list of aASP recipients to which the indicated eASP is requested to deliver the

flight plan data. The identity and the address data of each recipient should be
provided. Their identity is expected to be provided using the appropriate location
indicator and aeronautical authority and service designator as per ICAO Docs. 7910
& 8585.

c) an indication of the eASP being requested to forward the flight plan data to all
relevant ASPs.

3.1.14 The operators need to take necessary actions to ensure that they are in receipt of

relevant Submission Response and Filing Status messages made available by all
relevant eASPs. **3.2** **PRELIMINARY FLIGHT PLAN SUBMISSION**

3.2.1 The Planning Service (and Preliminary Flight Plan) only exist as a FF-ICE service. There

is no equivalent ATS message and therefore no need for translation or
submission/distribution to non-FF-ICE units (aASPs). Preliminary Flight Plans and any
subsequent updates are therefore submitted directly by the operator to the relevant
eASPs thus facilitating the collaborative planning process. A detailed description of the
Planning Service is provided in chapter 4. **3.3** **FILED FLIGHT PLAN SUBMISSION**

3.3.1 An overview of the submission procedure applicable to the FF-ICE Filing Service within a

mixed mode environment is provided in Figure 2. In such an environment it is necessary
that the operator continues to take into consideration the procedure related to the
submission of flight plans published by the ATS unit responsible for the aerodrome of
departure. (see APPENDIX A – Key to Swimlane Diagrams)

ASPs in the appropriate format (eFPL or FPL). This may be achieved in different ways
depending upon circumstances, as illustrated in Scenarios 1, 2 & 3 below.

**Scenario 1: the departure ASP is FF-ICE capable (eASP) and has delegated responsibility**
for the distribution of flight plans to the operator. The operator, or its representative, is
willing and able to ensure all data are distributed in a consistent manner (see 3.4.3) and in
the correct format for each ASP.

3.3.3 If the ATS unit responsible for the departure aerodrome is not FF-ICE capable then the

operator, or its designated representative, shall:

a) Provide an eFPL to all relevant eASPs and;

b) Provide a FPL in accordance with published procedures for the departure aerodrome,

by either:

i. Submitting the FPL to the ATS unit responsible for the departure aerodrome. This

unit will then address and distribute the FPL to all ATS units concerned with the
flight. See Scenario 4 below.

or,

ii. Addressing and distributing the FPL to each concerned ATS unit which is not FF
ICE capable i.e. which is not included under a) above. See Scenario 5 below.

**Scenario 4: the departure ASP is not FF-ICE capable (aASP) and has not delegated responsibility**
for the distribution of flight plans to the operator. Note that eASPs in this scenario will receive the
FPL in addition to the eFPL.

a flight plan service provider or an eASP) that all data are distributed in a consistent manner (see
3.4.3) and in the correct format for each ASP. Note the FF-ICE status of the departure ASP is
irrelevant in this case: → the operator is obliged to submit an FPL to all relevant ASPs (eASPs and aASPs) in

accordance with local procedures and the provisions in PANS-ATM section 4.4.2.

**3.4.1 Procedure**

3.4.1.1 As the FF-ICE concept includes the provision of feedback by each eASP concerned

with the flight, the need for the departure ASP to pre-validate as performed by the ARO
today is less significant. Although the FF-ICE submission procedure (as illustrated in
Scenario 1 above) could provide the same basic errors to all ASPs, with subsequent
processing failures, possible manual intervention, and reception by the operator of
multiple error indications for the same error. This would be an inefficient process, albeit
primarily an automated one. However, the implementation of FF-ICE and the use of
automated tools and a more advanced format and communications technology is
expected to reduce, if not eliminate, the creation and exchange of basic format errors.

**3.4.2 Format**

3.4.2.1 In a mixed mode environment an eAU, its designated representative or an eASP

performing a translation and delivery or a forwarding process will be responsible to
provide current ATS message format to those ASPs unable to accept FF-ICE messages
(aASPs). They will therefore be required to translate the FF-ICE message into the
appropriate ATS message, see section 12.

**3.4.3 Content**

3.4.3.1 An eAU that engages in direct submission as per 3.1.3 or an eASP performing the

forwarding or the translation and delivery process as per 3.1.9 or 3.1.10, will also be
responsible to ensure that consistent and meaningful information is provided to aASPs.
For example, a modification to the trajectory, and therefore an update for eASPs, may
not be visible when expressed via the less detailed Field 15 format of a FPL, and
therefore not a modification for aASPs (see also 6.4.2.7).

**3.5** **FLIGHT PLAN EVALUATION & RE-EVALUATION**

3.5.1 An eASP, upon reception of a flight plan or Flight Plan Update, will evaluate the data

provided with respect to its area of responsibility. However, nothing precludes eASPs
from entering into bi-lateral or multi-lateral agreements as to the handling of flight plan
data. 3.5.2 The extent of the checks performed and the resultant status may differ from one eASP to

another usually depending upon the complexity of the ATM situation and/or the type of
airspace concerned. For example, an eASP responsible for an oceanic airspace may pay
more attention than an Approach ATS Unit would to the correct provision of a SELCAL
code. Nevertheless, the use of a standard exchange format will provide a level of
standardisation which, together with the guidance provided in Appendix E-1, will serve to
provide consistent logic checks.
The following list provides a non-exhaustive set of checks, presented within different
categories, that an eASP might choose to perform:

a) Data format and completeness — is the data correctly represented and all

compulsory data items present for the message or service being processed or
performed;

b) Flight Plan association — is the flight information received consistent with current

information. Is there an error with regard to the assigned GUFI. For example, for a
flight plan creation, does a duplicate flight plan(s) already exist, for an update is there
only one associated flight plan;

c) Flight authorisation — does the flight comply with any required prior-approvals in the

form of overflight permissions, etc. Does it comply with aerodrome curfew times.
Does it comply with safety or security requirements, certification, licensing, etc;

d) Flight capabilities — does the flight possess the capabilities, typically CNS

capabilities, for the airspace(s), routes or procedures it proposes to enter or perform;

e) Route/Trajectory — does the route/trajectory comply with the published ATM

configuration, airspace and route descriptions, valid transitions between routes, etc.
Does the route/trajectory comply with all published restrictions applicable to the flight;

f) Flight Constraints — does the route/trajectory comply with all constraint(s), such as a
required take-off time, which have been allocated to the flight.

3.5.3 Typically, most ASPs would perform at least some of the checks described in a), b), d), e)

& f) while probably very few would perform the sort of checks described in c), at least not
during the process of flight plan acceptance.

3.5.4 An eASP, when performing the checks referred to above and deciding the appropriate

action/response, should take into consideration any reason for special handling indicated
within the flight plan. For example, a flight indicated as Search and Rescue (SAR) or a life
critical medical emergency (MEDEVAC) should probably not be rejected.

3.5.5 The operator may indicate within the flight plan the applicable AIRAC cycle that was used

in the computation of the flight plan. Over the period of an AIRAC cycle switch this
information may be taken into consideration by an eASP in determining it’s processing
response. The information may also be made available to control staff if it is deemed by
the eASP to be advantageous to do so. This may depend on, for example, whether or not
the eASP’s area of interest has been modified in a significant way, such as a change to
the physical characteristics of published route(s), Navigation aid(s), waypoint(s), during
the latest AIRAC cycle.

3.5.6 An eASP is encouraged to publish a description of the type of checks performed. 3.5.7 Re-evaluation is an optional process (see Figure 8) that an eASP may perform to

determine whether or not a flight plan remains in compliance with published restrictions or
ATM measures that may have been applied or modified since the flight plan was last
evaluated. If provided, the process should be applied within both the Planning and Filing
services. The re-evaluation process, if provided, is advisory and does not relieve the
operator of its responsibility to ensure the proposed flight remains in compliance with
published restrictions and procedures.

3.5.8 It is highly recommended that a re-evaluation process is provided by an eASP

responsible for an airspace where frequent modifications to the ATM configuration occur.
Typically, this would be in complex airspace where traffic demand is high and/or in
airspace where other restrictions, such as military activity or severe weather conditions,
frequently occur. In the case where the Flight Plan is no **Planning/Filing**

**Flight Plan Originator (FPO)** longer acceptable the reason should **Status**

No feedback provided to

the operator (see 3.5.10a) 
3.5.9 The trigger that causes the eASP to re-evaluate a flight plan may be the modification of

the ATM configuration, a restriction or constraint, or the trigger may be a periodic review
of each flight plan, irrespective of other changes.

3.5.10 Basic re-evaluation can result in one of two primary outcomes:

a) the flight plan status remains unchanged — no feedback provided to the operator in

this case;

b) the flight plan status changes — a Planning or Filing Status response is provided in

this case, as appropriate.

3.5.11 There are additional possible outcomes of the re-evaluation process that an eASP may

implement. APPENDIX D – Re-Evaluation Feedback provides an overview of a more
comprehensive re-evaluation process and its possible responses.

3.5.12 The time period in advance of the flight during which re-evaluation is performed is at the

discretion of the ASP concerned, as local conditions may dictate specific needs or
constraints. During Planning the re-evaluation process should begin from the time the
Preliminary Flight Plan (PFP) is received. If a Preliminary Flight Plan is not regularly reevaluated by the eASP with feedback provided to the operator and duly taken into
consideration, then one of the main purposes of Planning is not being achieved. Reevaluation may continue right up to the Estimated Off-Block Time (EOBT) or even the
allocated Off-Block time, if applicable. However, it is clear that an operator may not be in
a position to respond to a late notification via the normal pre-departure flight planning
procedures. Similarly, constraints will also apply to the late acceptance by ATM/ATC of
flight plan modifications[5]. Local procedures, particularly at aerodromes where a fully
integrated A-CDM process exists, may have procedures in place that enable relatively
late modifications to be coordinated and implemented.

3.5.13 The operator is expected to react to the reception of a Planning or Filing Status taking

into account any changes to the restrictions/constraints and/or the route/trajectory
(Negotiating or Agreed, as applicable) calculated by the eASP, see sections 4.3 and 6.3.
As described in 3.5.12, the ability of an operator to respond to a Filing Status received
close to EOBT may be limited requiring either a post-departure procedure[5] to be invoked
or a tactical intervention by controller and/or pilot. See also section 6.3.9.

**3.6** **eASP RESPONSE PROCESSES**

5 Required changes to the route/trajectory close to, and after, the EOBT will be part of post-departure FFICE procedures. 
3.6.1 An eASP, upon reception of a FF-ICE message, is expected to perform an evaluation

process, as described in 3.5. Having performed an evaluation, the eASP will decide
whether or not the data received can be processed and the information provided can be
accepted, retained and acted upon. The result of the evaluation process will be provided
to the originator of the message.

3.6.2 While basic syntax and semantic rules or criteria (see Appendix E-1) are expected to be

applied, each eASP has the discretion to determine the extent of the evaluation
performed and the criteria against which it is decided to retain or reject a flight plan, or a
flight plan modification. The evaluation of circumstances, such as airspace type, traffic
density, etc., will differ from one eASP to another meaning a particular discrepancy that
may be tolerable for one eASP may cause a rejection within the airspace of a different
eASP.

3.6.3 Two types of response are foreseen; Submission Response and either the Filing or

Planning Status, as applicable.

The Submission Response (see 3.6.8) is provided immediately to the originator indicating
whether or not the received message is assessed as valid and will be retained and acted
upon or whether it is assessed as invalid and is therefore rejected. A rejection response
indicates that no data has been retained by the eASP. All messages provided to an
eASP, other than response messages, should receive a Submission Response.

The Filing Status (6.3) or Planning Status (4.3) provides information concerning the status
of the flight plan, and typically concerns route/trajectory acceptability.

3.6.4 A Filing or Planning Status message (as appropriate) may be triggered by the reception

of the following message types or by a re-evaluation of the flight plan where, for example,
a modification to the ATM configuration, such as a change of airspace availability, is
detected:

      - Preliminary Flight Plan

      - Filed Flight Plan

      - Flight Plan Update

3.6.5 An eASP that provides a re-evaluation process would normally be expected to provide a

Status response at the same time as the Submission Response, knowing that any
subsequent modifications to the status will also be provided. However, there are two
circumstances when an operator may receive status messages sometime after the
message was submitted and the submission response was received:

a) the Filed Flight Plan has been received well in advance of the flight by an eASP that

doesn’t provide a re-evaluation process. In this case the status response will be
provided at a time when the eASP considers it is able to provide the most meaningful
feedback in due time for the Operator to react, as may be required. In this case,
although the real operational status will be provided later, the eASP should still
provide an immediate Filing Status response with a status indication of PENDING; 
b) the eASP provides a re-evaluation process (see 3.5.7) in which case a status

message(s) will be provided to the operator when, as a minimum, a change of status
has been detected by the eASP. This can happen if, for example, an ATFM measure
has been implemented which impacts the previous status.

3.6.6 The availability of two types of response provides the eASP with greater flexibility,

enabling acceptance of a submission and retention of the flight intent for planning
purposes while at the same time being able to indicate that, for example, the
route/trajectory does not comply with all restrictions. The flexibility to retain a flight plan
submission containing a route/trajectory which does not conform with all restrictions is
intended as a feature of the Planning Service as it facilitates the subsequent negotiation
of the optimal route/trajectory.

3.6.7 It is not recommended that eASPs provide the same flexibility when the flight plan is filed,

for two main reasons:

      - earlier determination of flight intent during Planning facilitates greater efficiencies;

      - modifications (potentially many systematic modifications) to the Filed Flight Plan

may result in numerous modification (CHG) messages being received by aASPs,
some of which may be reliant upon a manual procedure.

**3.6.8 Submission Response**

3.6.8.1 The Submission Response (see Figure 9) is always an immediate response provided by

an eASP to the message originator indicating retention or rejection of the message
received. A response may also be given indicating that the received message is being
handled manually, in which case, once manual processing has been completed a
second Submission Response will be sent indicating retention or rejection of the
message.

message type 
3.6.8.2 Each message received by an eASP should result in a Submission Response.

3.6.8.3 An “acknowledge” (ACK) response indicates that the message received can be

processed by the eASP and will be acted upon.

_Note: Reception of a Submission Response with an “ACK” indication does not_
_necessarily mean that the flight plan data are operationally acceptable, without the need_
_for change._
_The acceptability of the flight plan, as perceived by each eASP, is subsequently_
_provided within the Planning (4.3) or Filing (6.3) Status response, as applicable._

3.6.8.4 Reception of a Submission Response with a “rejected” (REJ) status indicates that the

message received could not be processed. The message has therefore not been
processed or acted upon by the eASP and none of the data has been retained.
If the message being responded to is related to the submission of a flight plan then, as a
consequence, the flight plan will not exist as far as that eASP is concerned.
If the message concerned is an update to an existing flight plan then the update will not
have been applied by that eASP.
An operator, having received a REJ response from an eASP, is required to make the
necessary correction(s) and to re-submit the information. The re-submitted information
should be provided to all relevant ASPs, not only the one having rejected the original
submission.

3.6.8.5 Reception of a Submission Response with a “manual” (MAN) status indicates that the

message has been queued for manual processing. It is an indication to the message
originator that some time may be needed before a second Submission Response
indicating an ACK or REJ can be expected.
As FF-ICE processes are expected to be highly automated manual interventions should
be very limited. However, occasionally an error can occur within the ATS system, such
as an error within the ATM configuration data or a system error, which therefore cannot
be overcome by the message submitter. Only a manual intervention on behalf of the
ATS system can resolve the problem.

3.6.8.6 As described in 3.5.2 an eASP has the discretion to determine if a message will be

retained and acted upon (ACK) or if it will be rejected (REJ). The decision to reject a
message is not always due to syntax errors. The examples listed as a), b) and c) in
3.5.2 are typical cases that may result in a rejection.

**3.6.9 ‘Non-Compliance’ Feedback**

3.6.9.1 An eASP, when providing feedback to the message originator via either a Submission

Response or a Planning/Filing Status concerning a data error or non-compliance with a
published restriction, is expected to provide an indication of the problem. This may
include reference to the published restriction and, when applicable, an indication of its
impact, the resultant constraint. For example, if the route of flight penetrates an airspace
that is closed due to military activity the feedback will indicate the non-availability of the 
route or airspace and may make reference to the publication where the airspace
availability, or lack thereof, has been made available. If the flight is subject to an ATFM
restriction resulting, for example, in the allocation of a target time, reference to the
published ATFM restriction may be provided together with an indication of the allocated
time; i.e. the constraint.

3.6.9.2 When a problem is caused by non-compliance with a published restriction reference

should be provided to the publication of that restriction using the published identifier.

3.6.9.3 Efforts are underway to establish a basic set of validation checks that are globally

applicable and can therefore give rise to a standard list of ‘error’ messages or message
sets. The information provided in APPENDIX E – Logic Rules is intended as a first step
in this process.

**3.7** **GUFI & FLIGHT PLAN ASSOCIATION**

**3.7.1 General**

3.7.1.1 The Global Unique Flight Identifier (GUFI) is intended to provide a unique reference to a

specific flight, civil or military. Its purpose is to assist in associating a message to the
correct flight and to help in distinguishing between similar flights. There can be multiple
flight plans with the same aircraft identification and departure point and it is not always
readily apparent when two flight plans are different versions for the same flight, or
different intended flights. The GUFI will resolve such situations.

3.7.1.2 Most ATM systems today rely upon a comparison of various “key fields”, such as

Aircraft Identification, Aerodrome of Departure, EOBT, etc., to identify a flight and to
distinguish one flight from another. This method can however give an unreliable result
particularly if, for example, a flight is delayed and/or the aircraft identification is the
registration and therefore the same for each flight.

3.7.1.3 The introduction of FF-ICE together with SWIM-type functionality facilitates a working

environment in which many transactions would be performed in an automated manner.
Such an environment, with potentially many transactions per flight, requires a quick and
reliable identification of the flight concerned and cannot depend on an unreliable
mechanism with frequent manual interventions to assist in determining the correct target
flight.

3.7.1.4 An important principle behind the introduction of a globally unique identifier (PANS-ATM

17.4.1) is that it should identify only one flight and each flight should be identified by a
single identifier (see 3.7.2 for the determination of ‘a flight’) .
If a flight plan is cancelled and a new flight plan is submitted, the new flight plan shall
contain a new GUFI even if the new flight plan relates to what the operator will consider
to be the same flight. Alternatively, in place of the cancel and re-file option, or the flight
plan is updated, the new flight plan can be provided with the same GUFI but with an
incremented flight plan version and as a consequence it will be treated as a complete
replacement of the existing data. See 3.7.4.3 and 6.4.3.7. 
3.7.1.5 As the GUFI identifies an individual flight it is therefore understood that the operator will

only assign a GUFI to a flight when it is prepared to engage in communications
concerning a specific flight. A GUFI will therefore not be allocated to schedule
information which is repetitive by nature and therefore relates to multiple flights.

3.7.1.6 In addition to identifying the correct flight to which a message or transaction should be

associated, the GUFI together with the flight plan version number will also assist in
distinguishing between different flight plans e.g., answering the question “do these two
flight plans concern one flight or two different flights?”

3.7.1.7 Although the GUFI should help to provide a clear indication of the target flight and of the

operator’s intent with regard to the operation of one or more flights, in the early days of
implementation, before GUFI allocation and handling by all parties can be completely
verified in operations, it would be more reliable for the systems to continue to use
additional information to verify flight association. Furthermore, it needs to be considered
that in a mixed mode environment, some flight plans will not include a GUFI.

3.7.1.8 An incorrect GUFI indication can result in data being applied to the wrong flight plan and

must be avoided. While this is a significant error the introduction of the GUFI as an
additional key field means the frequency with which it happens should be reduced in
comparison to current practices. It is interesting to note that an update which contains a
significant change (e.g., aircraft type changed to a C172, wrongly applied to a long haul
commercial flight) will quickly fail further processing while a less significant change may
go undetected.
It is therefore recommended that, at least during initial implementation of FF-ICE and/or
initial implementation by a new eFPL provider, some data validation that includes the
GUFI is performed, particularly upon reception of a flight plan.

**3.7.2 Determination of “A Flight”**

3.7.2.1 For the purpose of GUFI allocation “a flight” is considered to be the operation of an

aircraft with a specified aircraft identification, at a specified departure aerodrome, at a
specified date and time, from first submission of the flight plan (Preliminary or Filed) until
in-blocks at an arrival aerodrome.

It is worth noting that each leg of a multi-leg operation is therefore defined as a different
flight (it will depart from a different specified aerodrome), from an ATM perspective, and
shall be allocated a different GUFI.

3.7.2.2 A flight is considered to have taken place once the aircraft has completed its planned

operation at its destination aerodrome or, it has landed at a diversion aerodrome.
Therefore, following a diversion a subsequent attempt to reach the destination
aerodrome will require a new flight plan and a new GUFI. Likewise, a flight which needs
to return and land (a diversion from its planned operation) at its departure aerodrome
immediately after becoming airborne will require a new flight plan and a new GUFI, if it
wishes to re-attempt the flight as originally planned.

3.7.2.3 An aircraft that is obliged to return to its parking stand prior to becoming airborne; i.e. a

“ground return” or an aborted take-off, may retain the flight plan and its GUFI if it is 
intended to continue the flight. This is based on the concept that ATC systems can
perform a “roll-back” of the flight prior to it becoming airborne. If there is no intention to
continue the flight, the flight plan should be cancelled.

**3.7.3 Flight Plan Association**

3.7.3.1 The process of determining whether or not two flight plans actually refer to just one

flight, or the difficulties sometimes encountered in determining the correct flight to which
an update should be applied, is not new. ATM systems have been dealing with these
problems for many years, sometimes having to resort to manual intervention.

3.7.3.2 The introduction of FF-ICE, GUFI and more data sharing processes will provide an

opportunity to perform better association of received information with a specific flight,
and to detect inconsistencies (e.g., two flight plans for the same flight). To avoid
differences in acceptance of a flight plan between different eASPs, it is strongly
recommended that a flight plan that will be relevant to multiple ASPs be subject to the
flight plan association checks in APPENDIX F – Association Checks. A flight plan for a
flight that remains within the scope of a single ASP can be validated against local rules.

3.7.3.3 In determining whether or not two flight plans refer to the same flight, it is common

practice to use the aircraft identification, the departure aerodrome and the off-block date
and time. Use of the destination aerodrome is not recommended on the basis that two
flights departing the same aerodrome at the same time using the same identification
should probably not be accepted even if they have different destinations.

3.7.3.4 Most of the issues encountered today concern timing aspects; i.e. how far apart the

EOBTs have to be before two flight plans with the same aircraft identification and
aerodrome of departure can be accepted as two distinct flights. Different ASPs will have
implemented different solutions with differing complexity based on factors such as the
total estimated elapsed time of each flight, whether or not the two flights would exist in
the same airspace at the same time, etc. The most significant ASP in making this
determination is the ASP responsible for the departure aerodrome. It is therefore
suggested that eASPs which are not responsible for the departure area i.e.,
downstream eASPs, could place greater reliance on the GUFIs.

3.7.3.5 Assessment of the timing aspects for flight plan association should not be rigidly applied

in the processing of modifications to the EOBT. An operator who has planned to fly a
series of flights should not be obliged to delay each flight in reverse chronological order
to achieve a delay to the first flight.

**3.7.4 GUFI Procedure**

3.7.4.1 The operator, or its designated representative, is required to generate and allocate a

GUFI to its FF-ICE flight plan. It is important that only one GUFI is allocated to a flight
and this can only be assured by ensuring that the GUFI is allocated at source by the
operator, or its representative, upon creation of the flight plan.

3.7.4.2 The operator should ensure that all flight data submitted for a flight is submitted using

the same GUFI. This applies to both the Preliminary and Filed versions of the flight plan.
It also applies to a Trial Request when a Preliminary or Filed Flight Plan already exists 
for the flight. This will enable the ATM system to ensure that, in assessing the impact of
a Trial Request, it doesn’t include the same flight twice.

3.7.4.3 An eASP on reception of a Preliminary or Filed Flight Plan (a new flight plan creation)

should use the logic in APPENDIX F – Association Checks to verify that:

      - the same Preliminary Flight Plan or the same Filed Flight Plan does not already

exist with a different GUFI. It is of course normal that, upon Filing, a Preliminary
Flight Plan may already exist for the same flight with the same GUFI;

      - the same GUFI does not already exist, at least within the operational database, for

a different flight plan.

If the same Preliminary Flight Plan or the same Filed Flight Plan does exist with the same
GUFI and the new submission has a later version number, it should be treated by the
eASP as a complete replacement of the existing data. See also 6.4.3.7.

3.7.4.4 On reception of an update or cancellation message, an eASP will use the GUFI as an

index to obtain the target flight plan. It is nevertheless recommended that, having
obtained the flight data using the GUFI, the eASP performs a verification of the GUFI by
ensuring that the other key fields used for message association are consistent.
However, in circumstances in which the operator and service provider systems have
successfully achieved some form of integrity testing the eASP might choose to rely
purely upon the GUFI without further verification.

3.7.4.5 In the case of a missing flight plan an eASP would be expected to obtain the flight plan,

and the GUFI, through the use of the Flight Data Request service as described in
section 8.

3.7.4.6 In translating an eFPL into a FPL for transmission to non-enabled ASPs the GUFI will

not be provided.

**3.7.5 GUFI Composition**

3.7.5.1 A GUFI shall include a version 4 “Universally Unique Identifier" (UUID), as standardised

by IETF RFC 4122 of the Open Software Foundation (OSF) and documented by the
International Standards Office (ISO/IEC 9834-8: 2014) and the International
Telecommunications Union.

3.7.5.2 The GUFI’s UUID shall be supplemented with the following additional information:

1. A namespace identifier to record the originator of the GUFI. Namespaces are used in

a variety of settings to both organize content as well as help ensure that content is
uniquely identifiable. In FF-ICE, the originator of each GUFI can construct their own
namespace as described in Appendix G-1 to ensure that no GUFI generated with a
given namespace can be a duplicate of a GUFI generated with any other
namespace.

2. A GUFI creation timestamp to further decrease the chances of a GUFI collision.

Timestamps will also ensure the GUFI is perpetually unique over any period of
interest. 
**3.7.6 Validation of a GUFI Generator**

3.7.6.1 Testing can validate the proper generation of the namespace portion of the GUFI. It

should be static for a given originator, and can be readily examined for correctness.

3.7.6.2 Validation of the flight-specific UUID portion of the GUFI will depend somewhat on

verifying the use of a suitable generation method per appropriate standards. Testing can
be used to check for duplication with previously assigned UUIDs.

3.7.6.3 Validation of the timestamp portion of the GUFI will include checking that the timestamp

is in an appropriate Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) format.

**3.7.7 Validation of the assigned GUFI**

3.7.7.1 In addition to mitigating any small residual risk of GUFI duplication at generation there is

also a risk associated with mismanaging the assignment of a generated GUFI to a flight
plan. It is absolutely critical that two flights in the operational ATM system not have the
same GUFI. Therefore, operators are encouraged to consider additional safeguards that
ensure an assigned GUFI has not already been assigned to another flight, including one
that may have been subsequently cancelled. **3.8** **VERSIONING & REFERENCE INFORMATION**

**3.8.1 Versioning**

3.8.1.1 FF-ICE is intended to facilitate a systematic exchange of data between operators and

eASPs. In the context of Planning and trajectory negotiation in particular, such a
systematic negotiation process can give rise to a significant number of modifications to
the flight plan, performed over a period of time. In order to assist in data synchronisation
and in providing a reference for feedback, the operator is required to provide an
indication of the flight plan revision, i.e. its flight plan version.
The FF-ICE concept also includes the notion of an eASP flight plan version indicator.
Use of an eASP version indication has not yet been described and is expected to
become more relevant during post-departure planning processes.

3.8.1.2 The complete set of data held by the ATM system for a particular flight may include data

items for which the operator is not wholly responsible. Such data items are not part of a
flight plan submission and typically will be associated with traffic management and/or ACDM processes that take place close to departure. The operator flight plan version only
relates to the provision and update of flight plan data provided by the operator. Flight
plan data which has not been provided or updated by the operator is not expected to
modify the operator flight plan version.

3.8.1.3 The flight plan version number is intended to provide both a reference to a particular

version but also an indication of the sequence in which versions have been created. It
shall therefore be an incremental number.

3.8.1.4 The threshold value for different flight data beyond which a change to the flight plan

should be triggered, together with a new version number, may be specified by the local
eASP. In this initial FF-ICE implementation, threshold values to be applied globally are
not specified however, as a minimum, changes requiring a modification to the flight plan
today (FPL) shall also be applied to an FF-ICE flight plan and result in a new version
number.

3.8.1.5 As an FF-ICE flight plan can contain more detailed information, such as trajectory and

performance data, it is recommended that all modifications provided by the operator
should be accompanied by an increment to the version number.

3.8.1.6 In nominal circumstances an FF-ICE flight plan would be expected to begin as a

Preliminary Flight Plan, as used during Planning, and then to be replaced or superseded
by the creation of a Filed Flight Plan (eFPL), containing of course the same GUFI. The
version numbering should be continued across this transition with the eFPL containing a
version which is one increment higher than the last version used during Planning.

3.8.1.7 The combination of version number and GUFI should provide a unique reference, i.e. for

a given flight (GUFI) a version number should not be repeated.

**3.8.2 Referencing** 3.8.2.1 The feedback, in the form of a Submission Response or a Planning or Filing Status,

provided by the eASP to the operator should reference the version used for determining
the feedback.

3.8.2.2 An operator that elects to perform Planning on an ad hoc basis, choosing to negotiate

with different eASPs at different times and therefore probably using different versions,
must keep in mind that the version contained in the response from each eASP, which
may be a delayed or non-immediate response, will reflect the same ad hoc pattern. A
compromise needs to be determined by the operator between:

      - a parallel approach, providing at the same time all eASPs, with which Planning is

required, with the Preliminary Flight Plan and every version update thus ensuring
that a response provided by an eASP would normally refer to the latest version;

and

     - an ad hoc individual approach in which the operator negotiates with eASPs

independently. This approach may suit the business planning of the operator, to
determine the constraints of the most complex eASP first.

3.8.2.1 In order to ensure that all relevant eASPs offering a Planning Service are provided with

up-to-date and consistent information concerning the flight it is recommended that the
operator employs the parallel approach.
It should be noted that in using the ad hoc approach, any assumption that a particular
update will not impact eASPs downstream is far from obvious.

3.8.2.2 Regardless of the approach being employed, once an eASP has been included in the

planning process through the provision of a Preliminary Flight Plan it must then be
provided with all subsequent versions. This will ensure that all eASPs aware of the flight
have consistent information. It will also ensure that all Planning Status messages
received by the eAU will refer to the latest version of the PFP.

3.8.2.3 If the eAU has not provided an eASP with all subsequent versions, in order to bring that

eASP up to date the eAU is required to submit a complete flight plan (PFP) containing
the latest information and the latest version number.

3.8.2.4 Once an eFPL has been filed, the eFPL and all subsequent updates are required to be

provided to all ASPs. All eASPs should therefore be in receipt of the same version
number as that maintained by the operator. This version number, if provided to the pilot,
would allow ATC and the pilot to verify they are using the same version of the flight plan.
If included in on-board systems it would enable a synchronisation check to be
performed between ground and airborne systems, as may be required.

**3.8.3 Sequencing**

3.8.3.1 As described above, the Planning procedure, and in particular the ad hoc approach,

does not allow a strict sequencing to be imposed or expected on first reception of the
flight plan. An individual eASP cannot assume that the first reception of a Preliminary
Flight Plan will begin with version “1”. When using the ad hoc approach, it is the
Operator’s responsibility to send a complete Preliminary Flight Plan at the correct
version when adding an eASP to the negotiation. The same applies to the filed eFPL. As the version numbering is required to continue
from Planning through to Filing, the filed eFPL may contain a version number higher
than “1”.

3.8.3.2 As a consequence, the following guidance applies:

a) A recipient shall discard (and not process) a PFP, eFPL, or Flight Plan Update whose

version number is lower than the version of flight plan information currently held. The
submission response for such a message should be a REJ unless circumstances
(e.g. recovery from a network failure) indicate the message can be accepted and
discarded.

b) A recipient shall reject a Flight Plan Update whose version number is more than one

higher than the version of flight plan information currently held. This jump in version
number indicates that the recipient has missed updates and therefore has inaccurate
flight plan data.

c) When a rejection of a Flight Plan Update message due to a version mismatch is

received, the operator or designated representative shall submit the latest version of
the complete flight plan (PFP or eFPL as appropriate).

Note: An update to flight data received from other sources, such as A-CDM, is not

expected to update the operator’s flight plan version.  ## 4 PLANNING SERVICE

**4.1** **GENERAL**

4.1.1 The Planning Service is an optional service expected or recommended to be provided by

an eASP whose airspace is complex and/or regularly constrained. Typically this would be
the result of high traffic demand where an ATFM service is already provided. However, an
airspace where other restrictions, such as military activity or severe weather conditions,
frequently occur may also benefit from the provision of a Planning Service.

4.1.2 In circumstances where restrictions frequently occur over an area that may encompass

more than one ASP some form of collaboration between ASPs is recommended to
ensure, as far as possible, an efficient and consistent feedback to the operator that
addresses the restrictions within the complete area.

4.1.3 The Planning Service provides a CDM process between the operator and the eASP(s)

concerning the intended operation of a flight.

4.1.4 The Planning procedure is therefore intended to serve two main purposes:

a) assist the operator in determining the optimal route/trajectory for a flight by identifying

the ATM configuration and restrictions applicable to the flight as proposed; and

b) enable eASPs to obtain an earlier, more detailed and more accurate assessment of

the anticipated traffic demand. Such an improvement in predictability will enable the
ATM services to provide greater flexibility and the ability to facilitate the operator in
overcoming short-term difficulties. Figure 10 illustrates this improvement cycle. ### Planning

Figure 11: Planning Service

4.1.6 The Preliminary Flight Plan information provided by the operator to obtain the Planning

Service will be retained and used by the eASP for traffic and resource planning
processes. The Preliminary Flight Plan information is therefore used operationally and
should be either maintained by the operator as a true indication of the flight’s intent until
the flight plan is filed, or else cancelled, as appropriate.

Capacity Management


Years 4.1.7 Once a flight plan (eFPL) has been filed for the flight it becomes the reference for all ATM

purposes and the Preliminary Flight Plan is no longer relevant. Cancellation of the Filed
Flight Plan (eFPL) will result in the removal of all related flight plan data from further flight
plan processing.

4.1.8 An eASP that provides a Planning Service is expected to publish the fact, together with

appropriate submission and addressing information, via its AIP.

**4.2** **PLANNING PROCEDURE**

4.2.1 An operator wishing to obtain a Planning Service (see Figure 12) should submit, in

accordance with the procedures described in 3.1, a Preliminary Flight Plan (PFP) to the
eASP(s) that provide a Planning Service and from which it wishes to receive the service.
It is therefore at the discretion of the operator to determine with which eASPs it considers
it necessary to perform the negotiation or planning exchanges prior to filing the flight plan.
For example, an operator may choose to perform the planning procedure with the most
constrained eASP first. As an operator may perform planning with individual eASPs, and
at different times, the operator should ensure that all updates to the Preliminary Flight
Plan are provided to all eASPs either currently or previously engaged in the planning
process for the concerned flight.

Route/Trajectory

3.5.1 **Referenc** 4.2.2 In choosing the eASPs with which it wishes to perform the Planning Service, priority is

expected to be given to the departure eASP (as it is the one that may or may not issue a
departure clearance!), and any eASP along the route of flight where restrictions can be
expected. An eASP which is many hours flying time away may not be able to offer much
detailed feedback. Nevertheless any feedback can be useful to the operator. In addition,
reception of the Preliminary Flight Plan by an eASP will allow it to assess, as early as
possible, the expected traffic demand to serve Capacity Management processes. It is
therefore recommended that the operator include all relevant eASPs that provide a
Planning Service in a Planning Service request.

4.2.3 In principle there are no limitations placed upon the earliest time when a Preliminary

Flight Plan may be provided. In practice however it is expected that individual eASPs may
publish a limit in accordance with local conditions and ATM system capabilities.
The latest time that a Preliminary Flight Plan may be filed is only limited by the need to
submit a Filed Flight Plan. Although a PFP may be accepted by the departure eASP
shortly before the EOBT, the resulting Planning Status may provide a NON-CONCUR
status with an indication that a Filed Flight Plan is overdue. The same response, when
provided as a result of the re-evaluation process, will serve as a reminder to the operator
that the eFPL has not yet been filed. The time in advance of the EOBT when such
feedback may be provided will likely differ from one eASP to another depending upon
local requirements for filed flight plan submission, as published via AIP. If the operator
does not provide a Filed Flight Plan in due time the Preliminary Flight Plan will eventually
contain an EOBT in the past. A PFP with an EOBT in the past, having already been
declared a NON-CONCUR status, should be discarded.
PANS-ATM para 11.3.2 provides a minimum requirement for the provision of basic flight
plan data for flow management procedures. This requirement can be achieved through
the submission of either a Preliminary or Filed Flight Plan. However, the Planning
Service, and Preliminary Flight Plan, are specifically intended for this purpose.

4.2.4 Having provided a Preliminary Flight Plan to the chosen eASPs the operator is expected

to take into account the feedback provided such as, restrictions applicable to the route or
airspaces concerned which have not been taken into consideration by the operator, any
applicable ATFM measures and their impact (if known at the time) and the operational
environment anticipated by the eASP such as runway-in-use and choice of SID/STARs.
Having re-assessed its options the operator is then expected to modify the Preliminary
Flight Plan, as may be required, in an attempt to reconcile the restrictions with its
business needs to obtain an optimal flight plan. This process may necessitate several
iterations to achieve a satisfactory result and to adapt as circumstances change.

4.2.5 An eASP should continue the evaluation process after having provided a first Planning

Status feedback (see 3.5.7). The Preliminary Flight Plan is re-evaluated as necessary to
determine whether or not its status may have changed due to changes in the operational
environment; i.e. the ATM configuration. A change of status will be notified to the operator
via the Planning Status response. It should however be noted that it is the responsibility
of the operator to ensure that its flight plan remains consistent with the ATM
configuration, restrictions and constraints. The re-evaluation process, where provided,
simply assists in ensuring that consistency is maintained. 4.2.6 A Planning request, provided through the submission of a Preliminary Flight Plan, may

contain the minimal content as described in Appendix C-2. Clearly the more information
that can be provided the more meaningful will be the response. However, even minimal
content; i.e. the intention to operate a flight from ‘A’ to ‘B’ at a particular date and time, is
useful information for the eASPs and can provide feedback useful for the operator.

4.2.7 For example, an eASP serving a highly constrained airspace may respond even to

minimal Preliminary Flight Plan information with an indication of restrictions and/or
constraints that may apply to the flight based upon the departure or destination airports
such as an arrival management process. For non-scheduled air transport operations or
General Aviation, the response may contain an indication of airport slot compliance.
Given minimal information; i.e. without route/trajectory data, some eASPs may have the
capability to propose, within the Planning Status response, the optimal route (from the
eASP perspective) within the airspace for which the eASP is responsible.

4.2.8 An eASP with the ability to propose an alternative route/trajectory, which may also include

an alternative set of restrictions and constraints including traffic management constraints,
may require the operator to respond to the proposal within a prescribed time, after which
the proposal may no longer be available.

4.2.9 A GUFI shall be allocated by the operator to the first submission of an FF-ICE flight plan,

normally the Preliminary Flight Plan, in accordance with the guidance provided in 3.7. The
same GUFI should then be used for all communications concerning the same flight.

4.2.10 In order to facilitate consistency requirements, allowing an eASP and/or operator to

ensure they are referring to the same information, the use of versioning and reference
information as described in 3.8 is required.

4.2.11 The operator should ensure that a Preliminary Flight Plan is provided only to eASPs

having published their provision of a Planning Service.

4.2.12 The Planning procedure, by definition, is intended to facilitate an exchange of information

between the operator and the eASP concerning the intended operation of a flight.
Rejection by an eASP of a Preliminary Flight Plan would not serve this purpose as it
effectively refuses the dialogue before it has begun and removes the intent to operate the
flight from the eASPs database. Rejection of a Preliminary Flight Plan is counterproductive. It is therefore recommended that the rejection of a Preliminary Flight Plan
should be limited to cases where the data cannot be processed due to basic data errors
or violation of database rules such as GUFI related errors.

4.2.13 The operator is encouraged to provide a “Desired” route/trajectory as described in B-3.1.

This will receive a response from the relevant eASPs, perhaps including a Negotiating
route/trajectory, to which the operator is then expected to respond, as required, by the
submission of an update to the Desired route/trajectory.

The Planning Service supports the following message exchanges: **From Operator:** **From eASP:**

Preliminary Flight Plan Submission Response

Flight Plan Update Planning Status

Flight Cancellation

**4.3** **PLANNING STATUS**

4.3.1 A Planning Status response is provided by the eASP to the message originator (in

addition to the Submission Response) to indicate the status of a Preliminary Flight Plan
and, if applicable, any effective constraints with which the flight plan is non-compliant (see
Figure 13). The Planning Status response is triggered under the following circumstances:

a) Following the acceptance by the eASP of a message (ACK Submission Response),

to indicate the resultant status of the flight plan;

b) Following the Re-Evaluation (see 3.5.7) of the flight plan during which a change to

the flight plan status has been detected;

c) The allocation of a constraint to the flight by the eASP.

4.3.2 If a received message is not accepted by the eASP, for whatever reason (REJ or MAN

Submission Response), no Planning Status will be provided.

4.3.3 A successful manual intervention will result in a subsequent ACK Submission Response

and a Planning Status. An unsuccessful manual intervention will result in a subsequent
REJ Submission Response and no Planning Status.

4.3.4 A Planning Status response should ideally be provided by an eASP as soon as

possible and updated, as may become necessary, via the re-evaluation process.
Under these circumstances a Planning Status may be provided by an eASP with or
shortly after the Submission Response.

4.3.5 The first provision by an eASP of the Planning Status may be deferred if:

      - the flight’s planned time of entry into the eASP’s area of responsibility is

beyond the planning horizon of the eASP concerned;

      - the eASP doesn’t provide a re-evaluation process and therefore will wait until

an optimum time when most restrictions likely to affect the flight are known.

4.3.6 The first Planning Status response (response to the submission of the Preliminary

Flight Plan) should not be returned:

a) later than 3 hours before EOBT, provided the submission was delivered in due

time. In providing a timely feedback, allowances should be made for the
characteristics of the flight e.g., long haul versus short haul;

b) following reception of a Filed Flight Plan for the flight.

4.3.7 The Planning Status may provide feedback concerning any aspect of flight plan

acceptability as described in 3.5.1. The detail will vary from one eASP to another as
requirements and their relative importance will differ from one type of airspace to
another. Normally the Planning Status will provide feedback concerning the
route/trajectory. A Preliminary Flight Plan and Planning Update messages, which
received a Submission Response of ACK, shall receive a Planning Status response. A
Flight Cancellation will not receive a Planning Status (nor a Filing Status in the case
where a Filed Flight Plan exists).

4.3.8 An illustration of the Planning response process is provided in Figure 14. There are

three possible status indications that can be provided:

i. CONCUR — the flight plan and in particular the route and trajectory is acceptable

without the need for modification. This should mean that if the flight plan were to be
filed, it would be accepted.

It is worth noting however that although the route/trajectory complies with
applicable restrictions it doesn’t necessarily mean that all restrictions known by the
eASP are also known and taken into consideration by the operator. There are two
scenarios:

a) An applicable restriction is unknown to the operator but by chance the

route/trajectory is compliant;

b) A restriction in the form of an ATFM measure or an arrival management

process is applicable to the flight but due to the time at which the processing
occurs the impact (constraint) is not yet known and therefore cannot be applied
to the route/trajectory.

In case a) the restriction/constraint is not expected to be provided in the feedback by
the eASP. The feedback provided by the eASP is typically not expected to include
restrictions/constraints with which the route/trajectory is compliant. However, 
judgement should be applied in cases where a restriction, while currently met, would
not permit any significant changes. For example, if a flight plan is projected to clear
a military airspace moments before it becomes active, then a delay of even a few
minutes would cause it to have to deviate. It would be useful for the operator to know
about that constraint, even though the current submitted route/trajectory based on
the EOBT appears compliant.

In case b) reference to the applicable restriction is expected to be provided by the
eASP, even if the impact is not yet known. Once the impact is known and applied to
the route/trajectory it should be provided to the Operator in the form of a new
Planning Status indicating the constraint, the appropriate route/trajectory
(Negotiating or Agreed) and providing the resulting status in accordance with i, ii or
iii. (Note that the allocation of a constraint does not necessarily modify either the
route/trajectory or the status, for example, an “on-time” slot).

ii. NEGOTIATE — the flight plan, and in particular the route and trajectory, is

acceptable and would be accepted if filed. However the route/trajectory determined
by the eASP has included additional constraints and/or has applied ATM
configuration factors such as runway-in-use or Met data which may have resulted
in a route/trajectory that is different to the Desired route/trajectory. The operator is
expected to assess the feedback and determine whether or not it wishes to amend
its Desired route/trajectory. If filed without change, it may lead, in some cases, to a
clearance being received by the pilot that was not expected.

iii. NON-CONCUR — the flight plan does not comply with published airspace/route

availability or published restrictions and would result in a rejection or an
unacceptable status if the flight plan were to be filed.

4.3.9 A Planning Status response may include a Negotiating route/trajectory provided by

the eASP as an indication of the route/trajectory the flight is proposed to fly within the
airspace of the eASP. It may therefore cover only a part of the complete
route/trajectory of the flight. Where applicable, the Negotiating route/trajectory will
provide a detailed indication of the effective flight constraints that apply to the flight.
The Negotiating route/trajectory is provided as a proposal to the operator, and may
include a Respond-By time if a resource is being reserved pending a response. If the
appropriate response has not been received within the Respond-By time limit
provided, the conditions under which the Negotiating route/trajectory is proposed may
no longer be available or valid. On reception of a Negotiating route/trajectory the
operator is at liberty to either use or ignore the proposal in favour of its own
procedures for route/trajectory determination. The provision of a Negotiating
route/trajectory by the eASP is appropriate for a status response of NEGOTIATE or
NON-CONCUR.

4.3.10 A Planning Status response may include an Agreed route/trajectory provided by the

eASP as an indication of the route/trajectory on record with the eASP. In nominal
circumstances it is provided with a status response of CONCUR, indicating the
trajectory the flight would be expected to fly as determined by the eASP. It may
however be provided with a status response of NON-CONCUR thereby facilitating the
operator in determining why the eASP has assessed the route/trajectory as noncompliant. 
4.3.11 An eASP may provide a NON-CONCUR response if the proximity of the EOBT is such

that a Filed Flight Plan should already have been submitted for the flight.

**4.4** **FLIGHT PLAN UPDATE**

4.4.1 The procedures related to the modification of a Preliminary Flight Plan are practically

the same as those related to the modification of a Filed Flight Plan, only the list of
concerned eASPs may differ, and of course a Preliminary Flight Plan is never
provided to non-FF-ICE enabled ASPs.

4.4.2 See section 6.4 for a detailed description of the procedures related to flight plan

updates.

**4.5** **FLIGHT CANCELLATION**

4.5.1 The procedures related to the cancellation of a Preliminary Flight Plan are practically

the same as those related to the modification of a Filed Flight Plan, only the list of
concerned eASPs may differ, and of course a Preliminary Flight Plan is never
provided to non-enabled ASPs.

4.5.2 See section 6.5 for a detailed description of the procedures related to flight

cancellation. 
## 5 TRIAL SERVICE

**5.1** **GENERAL**

5.1.1 The Trial service is an optional service provided by an eASP. It offers a very similar

service to the Planning Service but with the important exception that the request is
treated by the eASP as a separate, standalone transaction which has no impact on
existing data.

5.1.2 A Trial request may be submitted to evaluate an alternative to an existing flight plan,

either Preliminary or Filed. Existing flight plan data will not be modified as a result of a
Trial Request. The eASP receiving a Trial request is not expected to retain information
related to the request and therefore will not be in a position to offer further information or
consultation concerning a Trial Request. Note that an eASP receiving a Trial request may
or may not be aware of the previously submitted flight plan, since the Trial Request could
involve a proposed routing into airspace not along the original route of flight.

5.1.3 An operator can use the Trial procedure to perform one or many “what-if” type of

investigations for an existing flight. It is possible that local implementations may limit, via
an automated system response, the number or frequency with which Trial Requests will
be accepted either for a single flight or generally (see 2.5.2.4).

5.1.4 The Trial service should not be used for long term planning such as a tool to maintain a

route catalogue; it is a service intended to evaluate alternatives for a flight, either
Preliminary or Filed, intended within the time limits established by PANS-ATM 17.4.2.3.

**5.2** **TRIAL PROCEDURE**

5.2.1 The Trial service supports the following message exchanges:

**From Operator:** **From eASP:**

Trial Request Submission Response

Trial Response

An illustration of the Trial procedure is provided in Figure 15.

5.2.2 The Trial service is initiated through the submission of a Trial Request, normally by the

operator, to the relevant eASP(s) in accordance with the procedure published by the
eASP(s) concerned.

5.2.3 A Trial Request may contain the minimal content as described in AppendixC-6.

|From Operator:|From eASP:|
|---|---|
|Trial Request|Submission Response Trial Response| 
5.2.4 A Trial Request that relates to an existing Preliminary or Filed Flight Plan should contain

the GUFI. This will assist the eASP that already received the existing Preliminary of Filed
Flight Plan, to ensure that the same flight is not considered twice when assessing the
impact of the request. A Trial Request that does not relate to an existing Preliminary or
Filed Flight Plan is not required to contain a GUFI.

5.2.5 As a Trial Request is a standalone operation with no impact upon the existing flight data

there is no consistency requirement and therefore no need to provide or maintain an
operator flight plan version indication.

5.2.6 The originator of the Trial Request should ensure that it is provided only to eASPs and

only to those that are relevant to the flight, as proposed in the request, and that have
published their provision of a Trial service. In order to evaluate a change of route, a Trial
request may be provided to an eASP that did not receive the Preliminary or Filed Flight
Plan.

5.2.7 The route/trajectory provided in a Trial Request shall be a Negotiating route/trajectory as

described in B-3.1.

5.2.8 An eASP, having received a Trial Request, will perform the same evaluations as those

performed for a Preliminary or Filed Flight Plan and will respond by providing the
Submission Response and Trial Response. The Trial Response process is identical to
that of the Planning Status response (see 4.3) with the exception that a Trial Response
will never contain an Agreed Route/Trajectory, only a Negotiating Route/Trajectory.

5.2.9 The originator of the Trial Request, on reception of a Trial Response, is expected to

associate the response to its originating request using the Message Identifier data item.
As a GUFI is not mandatory in a Trial Request (see 5.2.4) it cannot always be used as a
sole means of association. In addition, where multiple requests may have been provided
for the same flight, use of the GUFI alone will not resolve the association of a response to
its request. 
Figure 15: Trial Request & Response Procedure ## 6 FILING SERVICE

**6.1** **GENERAL**

6.1.1 The flight plan filing service is a mandatory service provided by an eASP which enables

an operator to submit the necessary information, and any subsequent updates, in order to
obtain air traffic services.

6.1.2 The existence, or not, of a Preliminary Flight Plan and the status of such a Preliminary

Flight Plan does not restrain the eAU in proceeding to the filing procedure. The operator
is at liberty to submit a Filed Flight Plan that could differ from the last version (see 3.8) of
the Preliminary Flight Plan. However, when supported by the Planning Service, the Filed
Flight Plan is more likely to be feasible and acceptable, both to the ATM services and to
the operator.

6.1.3 An operator should take care to ensure a flight plan is filed in due time, in accordance

with the published minimum and maximum time criteria. Engagement in Planning does
not fulfil the need to file a flight plan, nor does it fulfil the applicable timing requirements
for the provision of a Filed Flight Plan.

6.1.4 Once a flight plan has been filed it will become the reference for all ATM processes

concerning that flight. If a Preliminary Flight Plan existed prior to filing it will become
irrelevant once filing has been successfully achieved. Attempts by the operator to engage
further in planning activities concerning a Preliminary Flight Plan once filing has occurred
will be rejected by the eASP. If an operator wishes to determine the impact of potential
changes to a Filed Flight Plan it should, if the service is available, submit a Trial Request.

**6.2** **FILING PROCEDURE**

6.2.1 An eFPL should be filed (see Figure 16) in accordance with the appropriate submission

method as described in 3.1.1 and should contain the necessary data items as described
in AppendixC-4.

6.2.2 In submitting the Filed Flight Plan in accordance with 3.1.1 the operator should ensure

that the list of addressees includes all relevant addressees; i.e. in addition to the relevant
eASPs (who may or may not have been provided with a Preliminary Flight Plan) it should
also include any ASPs that need to receive the FPL format.

6.2.3 An eASP, having received a Filed Flight Plan (eFPL), is expected to evaluate it in

accordance with the guidance provided in 3.5. and to provide the appropriate feedback as
described in 3.6.8. (Submission Response) and 6.3 (Filing Status). An eASP that
provides a re-evaluation process (3.5.7) should continue the provision of Filing Status
feedback, as appropriate.

6.2.4 An operator, having received the feedback in the form of the Submission Response or

Filing Status is expected to react to the information provided as necessary by updating
the Filed Flight Plan to address identified restrictions/constraints.

6.2.5 The Filing procedure supports the following message exchanges: **From Operator:** **From eASP:**

accepted **6.3** **FILING STATUS**

6.3.1 A Filing Status response is provided by the eASP to the message originator under the

following circumstances:

a) Following the reception and acceptance by the eASP of a message (ACK

Submission Response), to indicate the resultant operational status of the flight
plan;

b) Following the Re-Evaluation (see 3.5.7) of the flight plan during which a change to

the flight plan status has been detected;

c) The allocation of a constraint to the flight by the eASP.

Note: In case a) if a received message is not accepted by the eASP, for whatever
reason (REJ Submission Response), no Filing Status will be transmitted.

6.3.2 A Filing Status response provides the result of an evaluation (see 3.5) performed by

the eASP. If the flight plan has been received by the eASP at a time which is in
advance of its processing horizon[6] for the flight, the eASP may defer its evaluation
and notify the operator accordingly (see 6.3.11). The first evaluation (and the first nonPending Filing Status response) should be performed no later than 3 hours before
EOBT, provided the submission was made in due time.
An eASP that provides a Re-evaluation process would normally provide an immediate
Filing Status response knowing that any subsequent changes will also be notified.

6.3.3 The Filed Flight Plan and Flight Plan Update messages which received a Submission

Response of ACK, shall receive a Filing Status response. A Flight Cancellation will not
receive a Filing Status response.

6.3.4 An illustration of the Filing Status response is provided in Figure 17. There are three

possible status indications that can be provided within a Filing Status response:

i. ACCEPTABLE — the flight plan, and in particular the Desired route/trajectory, is

acceptable.

It is worth noting however that although the route/trajectory complies with
applicable restrictions it does not necessarily mean that all restrictions known by
the eASP are also known and taken into consideration by the operator. There are
two possibilities:

a) a restriction exists which is applicable, is unknown to the operator, but by

chance the route/trajectory is compliant; and

b) a restriction in the form of an ATFM measure or an arrival management

process is applicable to the flight but due to the time at which the processing
occurs the impact is not yet known and therefore cannot be applied to the
route/trajectory.

6 The amount of time in advance of a flights expected entry into an eASPs area of interest, when the
eASP is able to process and evaluate the flight data against the ATM configuration In case a) the restriction is not expected to be provided in the feedback by the eASP.
The feedback provided by the eASP is not expected to typically include restrictions
with which the route/trajectory is compliant. However judgement should be applied
in cases where a restriction, while currently met, would not permit any significant
changes. For example, if a flight plan is projected to clear a military airspace
moments before it becomes active, then a delay of even a few minutes would cause
it to have to deviate. It would be useful for the operator to know about that constraint,
even though the current submitted route/trajectory based on the EOBT appears
compliant.

In case b) reference to the applicable restriction is expected to be provided by the
eASP, even if the impact is not yet known. Once the impact is known and applied to
the route/trajectory it should be provided to the Operator in the form of a new Filing
Status indicating the constraint and providing the resulting status in accordance with
i or ii. Note that the allocation of a constraint does not necessary modify either the
route/trajectory or the status, for example, an “on-time” slot.

ii. NOT ACCEPTABLE — the flight plan, typically the route/trajectory, does not

comply with operational requirements.

iii. PENDING — the flight plan has not yet been evaluated by the eASP.

Figure 17: Filing Status & Response Procedure 6.3.5 A Filing Status response with a status of ACCEPTABLE will mean that the two

trajectories, the Agreed Route/Trajectory determined by the eASP and the Desired
Route/Trajectory provided by the operator in the Filed Flight Plan, are within
acceptable limits for the eASP concerned (see 6.3.6 for an exception condition). An
overview of the Filing Status feedback is provided in Table 1.

The meaning of “acceptable limits” may differ from one eASP to another depending on
local factors, such as the type of airspace concerned. Ideally any differences between
the two trajectories should be sufficiently small so as not to be visible within the Field
15 format route description; i.e. the trajectories may be slightly different but the Field 15
format route description should be unaffected by the difference. The acceptable limits
should be objectively definable and consistently applied within an eASP.

The Filing Status response may include the Agreed Route/Trajectory, which provides
the operator with an indication of the trajectory the eASP anticipates the aircraft will fly
within its area of responsibility. While the operator is not obliged to react to the Agreed
route/trajectory, if provided, it is recommended that the operator assesses any
differences with a view to improving flight efficiency. To assist in this process, and to
help distinguish this case from the case described in 6.3.6, the Trajectory Purpose data
item may be provided by the eASP in the Filing Status response with the indication
“SYNC”. This informs the operator that the Agreed R/T is being provided as a means of
enabling the operator to synchronise its trajectory with that of the eASP eliminating, as
far as possible/practicable, any ‘within-acceptable-limits’ differences regarding
applicable constraints and details of eASP predictions. Synchronising trajectories is one
of the main objectives of trajectory based operations allowing both the operator and the
ATM functions to obtain the benefits that improved predictability can provide in terms of
flight efficiency and ATM resource management.

6.3.6 An eASP may have local agreements or procedures in place which allow it to unilaterally

assign a route to a flight. The Agreed route/trajectory returned by the eASP will provide
the route/trajectory the operator is expected to fly within the airspace of the eASP which,
in this case, may be significantly different to the submitted Desired route/trajectory. The
operator will therefore be required, in accordance with the local procedures, to take the
Agreed route/trajectory information into consideration making sure it is provided to the
pilot. In order to assist the operator in identifying when such a procedure has been
applied by the eASP, and to distinguish this case from the one described in 6.3.5, the
Trajectory Purpose data item may be provided, in accordance with the local agreement,
with the indication “ATC CHANGE”. The ‘ATC CHANGE’ flag indicates that a significant
modification has been applied by the eASP to the route, that is, a modification that
would affect the ATC clearance, such as a change to the lateral route description. It
should be noted that the Agreed route/trajectory provided by an eASP may cover only
a part of the complete route/trajectory of the flight.

6.3.7 Use of the Trajectory Purpose indication by an eASP is primarily intended to assist an

operator to readily identify the scenario described in 6.3.6. Although an analysis of the
Agreed route/trajectory will also reveal any differences between the Agreed trajectory
and the Desired or previously Agreed route/trajectory, initial implementors may not have
the ability to make such an analysis of complete trajectory information. In addition, the
ability to distinguish between the two types of change, as described in 6.3.5 and 6.3.6,
is more easily achieved by the originator of the change. Nevertheless, it should also be
noted that use of the Trajectory Purpose indicator by an eASP is advisory and the
operator remains responsible to ensure that feedback provided by the eASP is taken
into consideration and acted upon, as necessary. 6.3.8 A Filing Status response with a status of NOT ACCEPTABLE indicates that the flight

plan is operationally inconsistent with the ATM configuration and/or with restrictions
applicable to the flight. The response will indicate the inconsistency and the applicable
restriction.

6.3.9 An operator is expected to react to a NOT ACCEPTABLE status by making the

necessary changes and submitting a Flight Plan Update, as required. In determining
the best solution the operator may, if available, make use of a Trial Request(s). In
certain circumstances, such as close proximity to the EOBT, the operator may be
unable to respond to a NOT ACCEPTABLE status indication provided by the departure
eASP. In such circumstances the problem will be resolved by FF-ICE post-departure
procedures if available, or tactically by ATC. However, it needs to be understood that
such a scenario will represent an additional workload for both the controller(s)
concerned and pilot, a less efficient flight operation and, depending upon
circumstances, may adversely affect downstream units and the arrival planning at the
destination aerodrome. While making allowance for a short notice change of status, as
described above, an ASP may take measures to refuse start-up clearance to a flight
that has been informed of a change of status in sufficient time but has failed to act on
the information. The meaning of “sufficient time” may differ from one ASP and airport to
another depending on local factors. A fully coordinated airport with a complete A-CDM
process in place may be able to accommodate late changes to the flight plan better
than a non-coordinated airport. Typically “sufficient time” would be understood to mean
more than one hour in advance.

6.3.10 Local procedures may also include the ability for an eASP to provide, as the outcome

of a re-evaluation process, an alternative, proposed, route/trajectory in the form of a
Negotiating R/T potentially including constraints and possibly a Respond-By time,
indicating the time limit after which the proposal may no longer be available. Typically
such a proposal would have been triggered by a re-evaluation result of NOT
ACCEPTABLE, and therefore provides a possible solution. It is at the operator’s
discretion to either make use of the proposal made by the eASP or to determine an
alternative preferable solution.

6.3.11 A Filing Status response with a status of PENDING indicates that the eASP is unable

to perform an evaluation of the flight plan at the current time. Normally this may occur
if the flight plan has been received by the eASP at a time which is in advance of its
processing time horizon for the flight. Once the flight is within the processing horizon of
the eASP, evaluation will be performed and the Filing Status updated accordingly. A
Filing Status response with a PENDING status may indicate the time at which the flight
plan is expected to be evaluated (Expected Evaluation Time), and the Filing Status
updated. 
Table 1 Filing Status Response to eFPL Filing or Update

|Processing Result|Filing Status|eASP Feedback|Trajectory Purpose|eAU Response|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Compliant - may or may not have included changes to the ATM configuration inc. applicable restrictions/constraints|Acceptable|None|Not provided- not imperative to return a R/T.|No action required.|
|||Agreed R/T|Synch- The R/T on record showing applicable constraints and details of eASP predictions. Route is consistent with eAU submitted route but R/T details may differ.|No action is required from the operator. However, it is always recommended that the eAU takes note of the R/T on record with the eASP together with its restrictions & constraints, re-computes and updates its Desired R/T accordingly.|
|||Agreed R/T|ATC Change- The R/T on record that is modified from eAU submitted R/T to comply with all restrictions/constraints. It contains required elements (e.g. required reroute; controlled departure time; required altitude).|Action required. The operator needs to be aware of the changes and make the necessary adjustments to the operational flight plan. In addition, the eFPL should also be updated to ensure that all relevant eASPs are aware of the R/T and to ensure that the latest operator version number reflects the correct information, consistent with the operational flight plan.|
|Not Compliant- a restriction/constraint is not complied with or other flight plan data is inconsistent with the submitted R/T: violated business rules e.g. CNS incompatibility|Not Acceptable|None|Not provided- not imperative to return a R/T. The violated restriction/constraint will be indicated in the error message.|Action required. The operator is required to take note of the indicated errors, re-compute its Desired R/T as required and update its flight plan accordingly.|
|||Agreed R/T|Synch- The R/T on record showing applicable restrictions/constraints, some of which are not met. Route is consistent with eAU submitted route but R/T details may differ.|Action required. The operator is required to take note of the indicated errors, re-compute its Desired R/T and update its flight plan accordingly. In doing so it may consult the R/T on record with the eASP.|
|None - Processing not yet performed|Pending|None|Not provided|No action required. The message may provide an indication of the time at which the flight plan is expected to be processed by including the Expected Evaluation Time.|   
**6.4** **FLIGHT PLAN UPDATE**

**6.4.1 Submission**

6.4.1.1 In order to modify flight plan information, an operator should submit a Flight Plan

Update.

6.4.1.2 A Flight Plan Update should be submitted using the same procedure as that used to

submit the corresponding flight plan (Preliminary or Filed), as described in 3.1.

6.4.1.3 A Flight Plan Update should be provided to all eASPs having received the Preliminary

Flight Plan or, if a Filed Flight Plan has been submitted, to all eASPs having received
the Filed Flight Plan, as appropriate.

**6.4.2 Procedure**

6.4.2.1 A Flight Plan Update may be used to update either a Preliminary Flight Plan or a Filed

Flight Plan. As a Preliminary Flight Plan is effectively replaced by a Filed Flight Plan, an
eASP will apply an update to the appropriate data as required. It should be noted that
the transition from Planned to Filed cannot be achieved via an update. The filing
procedure requires submission of complete flight plan information in the form of an
eFPL, regardless of the existence of a Preliminary Flight Plan.

6.4.2.2 A Flight Plan Update may be used to update all items that may be included in a Filed or

Preliminary Flight Plan except:

a) The GUFI assigned to the flight; and

b) The aircraft identification.

Many ATS systems globally are unable to support a modification to the aircraft
identification as it is used as a unique key in accessing the flight data. Use of FF-ICE will
not automatically overcome these processing limitations. While Preliminary Flight Plans
will not be translated into FPL 2012 (only eASPs will receive Preliminary Flight Plans),
initially the same system limitations regarding modification of the aircraft identification may
exist. Therefore, global acceptability of aircraft identification modification for a Preliminary
Flight Plan cannot be guaranteed. However, nothing precludes a local system(s), capable
of accepting aircraft identification modifications, to continue to do so using FF-ICE
services for flights that are conducted entirely within their area(s) of responsibility.

6.4.2.3 A Flight Plan Update may be used for the removal of a previously provided flight data

item(s), provided the item is not mandatory.

6.4.2.4 Flight plan data items, other than those listed under 6.4.2.2, that are mandatory in a

Flight Plan Update (such as the Destination aerodrome) may be modified but not
removed.

6.4.2.5 When updating or removing data from a flight plan, care should be taken to ensure that

the resultant flight plan remains consistent; i.e. that individual data items are consistent 
with each other. Failure to do so may lead to a lengthy cyclic process as some errors or
inconsistencies may only become visible once others have been resolved.

Examples:

     - When updating the route/trajectory of a flight, the estimated elapsed time

information should be updated to correspond to the new route;

      - Updating the aircraft type should normally be accompanied by an update of aircraft

registration, possibly equipment and/or capabilities and other aircraft-related data
items;

      - Updating the aircraft type should normally be accompanied by an update of the

performance and trajectory data.

6.4.2.6 All updates to data items in a Filed Flight Plan that have an equivalent data item in the

FPL format (see chapter 12) should also be transmitted to relevant aASPs in the form of
a Modification Message (CHG), as defined in Appendix 3 of the ICAO Doc 4444.

6.4.2.7 There may be modifications to data items that are specific to the eFPL, such as

Dangerous Goods or Airport Slot information, or trajectory modifications that have no
impact on the Item 15 route description. Such changes should only be transmitted to
eASPs. If a CHG message were to be created in such circumstances the aASP would
receive a modification message that changes nothing!

For example, Figure 18 illustrates a modification to the anticipated departure procedure
within the route/trajectory. If the SID/STAR information is not included in the Field 15 route
description such a change will not be visible in a Modification Message (CHG).

6.4.2.8 When a route update leads to new eASPs becoming concerned with the flight, then:

      - The modified data should be provided within a Flight Plan Update/CHG to

eASPs/aASPs that have already received the Flight Plan, as appropriate; 
      - The complete set of flight plan data should be provided as an eFPL/FPL, as

appropriate, to the new ASPs that have become concerned with the flight;

      - The List of Recipients for each type of message should be updated/built

correspondingly.

**6.4.3 Content**

6.4.3.1 A Flight Plan Update shall include the data items as described in Appendix C-9.

6.4.3.2 A Flight Plan Update should contain the same GUFI as the Preliminary/Filed Flight Plan

to which it refers.

6.4.3.3 In order to assist in message association processes an update to any of the departure,

destination or EOBT information is achieved by indicating the new values that need to
be applied in addition to providing the existing values (prior to the update), which are
mandatory.

6.4.3.4 The Flight Plan Version (see 3.8) in a Flight Plan Update shall be a unique value for the

subject GUFI; i.e. no previous Preliminary or Filed Flight Plan submission for the GUFI
should have had the same version.

6.4.3.5 The flight plan version should be incremented by the operator each time a Flight Plan

Update is submitted.

6.4.3.6 A Flight Plan Update is only required to contain those items that have changed (in

addition to the mandatory items specified for an Update message); i.e. it is not
necessary to resend complete flight data. Data items that were included in the previous
version of the flight plan and have not been included in the Flight Plan Update will
remain unchanged. This means that a mechanism is required to identify when a flight
plan data item is to be deleted.

6.4.3.7 Systematic repetition of complete flight plan data, either in the form of a second flight

plan submission or within an Update message, is not a recommended practice. It can
place an unknown burden upon networks and creates undue complexity for both
software and operational personnel if there is a need to translate into CHG messages
for non-enabled ASPs. Re-submission by the operator of the flight plan as a complete
replacement of existing data should be used only when the recipient is more than one
version behind, has the flight in an unknown state after a system or communications
failure, has never received the flight plan because it was previously not relevant, or
route update leads to new ASPs becoming concerned with the flight and the message
submission is performed according to Scenario 2 or Scenario 3.

6.4.3.8 An eASP may publish threshold modification values that should trigger the transmission

of an update. For example, to what extent should a route/trajectory change, before an
updated trajectory should be sent. As a minimum, the criteria used in determining the
need to update a FPL should also be applied to the eFPL.

6.4.3.9 Individual elements within a repeating sequence of elements such as those found within

a route/trajectory group or a climb/descent performance profile cannot be modified or
deleted. The entire group must be updated as required. 
**6.4.4 Evaluation by eASP**

6.4.4.1 Taking into consideration the requirements specific to the Update message as

described in 6.4.2, an eASP should evaluate a Flight Plan Update against the same set
of criteria (see 3.5) as a Preliminary or Filed Flight Plan, as appropriate. The correct
application of flight plan versioning and sequencing as described in section 3.8 should
also be assessed.

6.4.4.2 The evaluation process should include the complete flight plan data set including both,

items that have been updated and items that have remained unchanged. Items that
remained unchanged will be copied from the previous flight plan data received for the
flight.

6.4.4.3 An eASP should respond to a Flight Plan Update by providing a Submission Response

(see 3.6.8) and either Planning (see 4.3) or Filing Status (see 6.3), as applicable.

6.4.4.4 Flight Plan Updates that attempt to remove mandatory data items should be rejected.

6.4.4.5 An eASP(s) that is no longer relevant to a flight as a result of a route update should be

informed of the change of route via a Flight Update Message. It should not be sent a
Flight Cancellation, as the flight has not been cancelled. The flight will still take place so
a cancellation message is wrong and misleading. It is incumbent upon the eASP to
determine that the flight is no longer relevant.

**6.5** **FLIGHT CANCELLATION**

**6.5.1 Submission**

6.5.1.1 In order to cancel a flight plan (Preliminary or Filed as appropriate), an operator should

submit a Flight Cancellation message.

6.5.1.2 A Flight Cancellation should be submitted using the same procedure as that used to

submit the corresponding flight plan (Preliminary or Filed), as described in 3.1.

6.5.1.3 A Flight Cancellation should be provided to all eASPs having received either the

Preliminary or Filed flight plan, as appropriate.

**6.5.2 Procedure**

6.5.2.1 A flight cancellation message should contain the data items as described in Appendix C
8.

6.5.2.2 A flight cancellation will terminate operational use of the GUFI and further processing of

any instances of the flight plan (Preliminary and Filed). Any further correspondence
(other than for historical archive purposes) with respect to the flight and/or the GUFI will
fail.

6.5.2.3 A cancelled flight cannot be re-instated and the GUFI from a cancelled flight cannot be

either re-instated or re-used. 
6.5.2.4 Once a flight has been cancelled, if the operator subsequently decides to operate the

flight, a new flight plan with a new GUFI will need to be submitted.

6.5.2.5 An operator, having submitted a cancellation message, should receive only a

Submission Response. Planning or Filing Status messages are not returned for a
cancellation message.  
## 7 NOTIFICATION SERVICE

**7.1** **GENERAL**

7.1.1 The Notification service is intended to notify relevant eASPs or eAUs of significant events

in the life cycle of the flight. An event would usually be a physical one related to the
progress of the flight such as Off-Block, Airborne, Landed, etc., as opposed to a status
which is usually specific to the local system. The information provided by the notification
service is significant in the further processing of the flight within the ATM system and
therefore the provider of the information needs confirmation that the information has been
received, just as the filing of a flight plan receives a confirmation response.

7.1.2 There are two events currently defined to be notified via the Notification service: the

departure and arrival notifications, which equate to the ATS messages DEP and ARR.
Although these two events are, by definition, post-departure their inclusion is considered
to be advantageous to early FF-ICE implementers giving them the ability to exchange
departure and arrival information within the FF-ICE environment rather than reverting to
the Aeronautical Fixed Service (AFS).

7.1.3 The provision of departure and arrival information is often subject to local and/or regional

agreements between ASPs and operators. These agreements may, depending upon local
circumstances and FF-ICE deployment planning amongst concerned actors, dictate that
sole use of the Notification service for departure and arrival notification cannot be
achieved at the same time and that use of the DEP and ARR messages via the AFS may
need to continue for a specified period. Therefore, while the ICAO provisions related to
the dissemination of departure and arrival information remain applicable, the use of the
Notification service to meet those requirements is currently defined as optional.

**7.2** **FLIGHT DEPARTURE**

7.2.1 A Flight Departure Message (see Appendix C-12) can be used in any situation where a

DEP message would have been used per PANS-ATM 11.4.2.2.6, if the relevant parties
have agreed. Otherwise, the DEP message described in PANS-ATM Appendix 3 should
be used.

7.2.2 The content of the FF-ICE Flight Departure message is equivalent to the DEP message,

with the addition of the GUFI. The GUFI and other key fields (Aircraft Identification,
Departure, Destination, and EOBT) are used to associate the departure message to a
specific flight plan, see section 3.7.

7.2.3 The actual departure time should, for consistency, reflect the Wheels-Off time of the flight.

However, in practice it is recognized that departure times are recorded by a number of
different automated and manual means which do not always refer to the same event or
location and often are only available to the nearest minute.

7.2.4 The Flight Departure Message can resolve any ambiguity by indicating the specific event

and location on an aerodrome to which the reported departure time refers, such as Off Block or Wheels-Off. 
7.2.5 An eASP having received a departure notification will respond with only a Submission

Response.

7.2.6 It is possible that a departure notification can raise an issue(s) with the operational

acceptability of the resultant route/trajectory, in case of a delayed departure for example.
Any such issue(s) will be notified and resolved via procedures that are applicable in the
post-departure phase of flight.

**7.3** **FLIGHT ARRIVAL**

7.3.1 A Flight Arrival message (see Appendix C-13) should, when possible, reflect the Wheels
On time at the arrival aerodrome and can be used in any situation where an ARR
message would have been used per PANS-ATM 11.4.2.2.7, if the relevant parties have
agreed. Otherwise, the ARR message described in PANS-ATM Appendix 3 should be
used.

7.3.2 The content of the FF-ICE Flight Arrival message is equivalent to the ARR message, with

the addition of the GUFI. The GUFI and other key fields (Aircraft Identification, Departure,
Destination, and EOBT) are used to associate the Arrival message to a specific flight
plan, see section 3.7. As with departure messages, in practice it is recognized that arrival
times are recorded by a number of different automated and manual means which do not
always refer to the same event or location and often are only available to the nearest
minute.

7.3.3 The Flight Arrival Message can resolve any ambiguity by indicating the specific event and

location on an aerodrome to which the reported arrival time refers, such as Wheels-on or
In-block at the parking position.

7.3.4 Note that both the destination aerodrome and the arrival aerodrome are included.

Inclusion of the destination aerodrome allows a recipient to match with a flight in their
database, while the arrival aerodrome indicates where the flight actually landed, typically
the same as the destination but would be different in the case of a diversion.

7.3.5 An eASP, having received an arrival notification, will respond with only a Submission

Response. ## 8 FLIGHT DATA REQUEST SERVICE

The flight data request service in a mandatory service for an eASP to provide. As a minimum the
service should provide the information outlined in 8.1.1.

An operator may optionally provide a flight data request service allowing, as a minimum, an eASP
to obtain the latest version flight plan for a flight.

**8.1** **TYPES OF INFORMATION REQUESTS**

8.1.1 In the FF-ICE environment, a Flight Data Request message can be used to obtain

information about a flight. The message is designed to allow customized flight data
queries (see Appendix C-10), but the following should be a minimum set for
implementation:

a) Flight Plan — request a copy of the flight plan, analogous to the use of the RQP ATS

message.

b) Supplementary Plan — request a copy of the supplementary data filed for the flight,

equivalent to use of the RQS ATS message.

c) Flight Status — request a copy of the latest Planning or Filing status for the flight.

8.1.2 A request for flight plan data should always refer to a Filed Flight Plan. A Preliminary

Flight Plan should not be returned in response to a flight plan request.

8.1.3 An eASP that provides a Planning Service may facilitate a request for Preliminary Flight

Plan data as a discrete request. The eASP would respond in accordance with the
guidance provided in 8.7. However, if a Filed Flight Plan already exists for the flight the
eASP may respond by providing the Filed Flight Plan.

8.1.4 An operator may also provide a query and reply service enabling an eASP to query the

flight data. This may be useful in any situation in which the information currently held by
the eASP is limited or of uncertain quality, but particularly useful in obtaining information
which is only required on an ad hoc basis and/or is typically only available shortly before
departure.

**8.2** **USES OF FLIGHT DATA REQUESTS**

8.2.1 The Flight Data Request service is intended to be used by ASPs to obtain required

information about a flight or by operators primarily to obtain the status of their own
flight(s), with respect to the eASP being queried. See also 8.5.

8.2.2 When an eASP is contacted about or receives an update for a flight for which they do not

have a flight plan, they can use a Flight Data Request to request the flight plan from
another eASP or from the operator, if the operator has implemented this service. 8.2.3 When an Operator is uncertain regarding the status of a flight plan, they can query a

Relevant eASP to obtain the flight plan status. An operator shall only request information
about their own flights.

**8.3** **EXTENSIONS OF FLIGHT DATA REQUEST**

8.3.1 If there is additional information about the flight that the eASP wishes to make available, it

can publish the indicator to be used in the Requested Flight Data item.

**8.4** **USE OF FLIGHT DATA REQUEST– FORMATTING, SENDING**

8.4.1 A request for flight information requires the data elements described in Appendix C-10.

8.4.2 Besides the normal addressing and contact information (to/from), there are just two things

required:

a) What flight is being referenced? At a minimum, the Aircraft Identification should be

supplied. Optionally, departure/destination data may be included to facilitate the
creation of an RQP or RQS to send to non-FF-ICE ASPs should the addressed
provider not have the plan. When an operator requests status information about a
flight, it must include the GUFI.

b) What type of information is desired? The type of information request should be

identified, as per 8.1.1.

8.4.3 The Flight Data Request should be used judiciously so as not to impose undue loads on

computer and network resources. For example, it should not be used in a polling manner
to query flight status at a higher frequency than the status is normally provided. eASPs
should consider publishing specific rules on acceptable use.

8.4.4 It is intended that this capability be used as a query regarding information about a single

flight. It is not intended as a capability for obtaining information on a set of flights, e.g., all
flights for a carrier. It is expected that Publication Services would serve that need and
provide the required bandwidth.

**8.5** **AUTHENTICATION AND CONFIDENTIALITY**

8.5.1 Requests for flight plan information shall be authenticated to ensure that they are from an

appropriate party such as relevant ASPs, the flight operator or a designated
representative. Requests that cannot be authenticated shall be rejected.

8.5.2 Sensitive flights (e.g., military or law enforcement) should receive special consideration;

eASPs should consider restricting access to sensitive flight plan data unless it can be
adequately assured that such sensitive data will not be disclosed to unauthorized parties.

8.5.3 Information security policies may require measures to ensure the confidentiality of flight

plan information; appropriate safeguards may be required to ensure that operators only
request information regarding their own flights.

**8.6** **VALIDATION** 8.6.1 A Flight Data Request should be checked to ensure that all required fields (per Appendix

C-10) are present and formatted correctly.

8.6.2 When provided, the GUFI should be checked to ensure that a flight plan with that GUFI

exists.

8.6.3 Other identifying information (aircraft identification and departure/destination/EOBT, if

provided) should be checked for consistency with the GUFI.

8.6.4 Depending on implementation, the source of the request should be checked to ensure

that it is allowed to query the identified flight.

**8.7** **FLIGHT DATA RESPONSE PROCEDURE**

8.7.1 The recipient of a Flight Data Request should return a Submission Response to the

sender as described in the following paragraphs.

8.7.2 If the request is incorrectly formatted, a submission response of REJ should be returned

with an explanation that the request was incorrectly formatted.

8.7.3 If the requested information is not found, a Submission Response of REJ should be

returned with an explanation that the recipient does not have the requested information.

8.7.4 If a flight plan is found for the provided GUFI but the other identifying information provided

does not match, a Submission Response of REJ should be returned with an explanation
that the provided information does not identify a single flight.

8.7.5 If the source of the request has no authorized access to the identified flight, a Submission

Response of REJ should be returned with an explanation that the recipient does not have
the requested information. Note that a response indicating non-authorization verifies for
the sender that the flight exists, which is information in itself. So a generic message
indicating that there is no information for the flight is preferable.

8.7.6 If the requested flight data are for items not supported by the eASP, a Submission

Response of REJ should be returned with an explanation that the request is not
supported.

8.7.7 If multiple flights, which the source is authorised to access, match the submitted flight

information, then a Submission Response of REJ should be returned, with an explanation
that includes the aircraft ID, departure, destination, EOBT, and GUFI of each matching
flight.

8.7.8 If the message passes all validation checks, a Submission Response of ACK should be

returned, together with a Flight Data Response containing the requested information per
Appendix C-11.
Note: No response is expected from the recipient of the Flight Data Response.  
## 9 PUBLICATION SERVICE

The Publication Service is an optional service that an eASP may provide to disseminate flight
information to multiple stakeholders in an efficient manner. As a minimum, the Data Publication
Service shall use the data conventions defined in Appendix B.

**9.1** **GENERAL**

9.1.1 An eASP may provide a Publication Service that enables authorised subscribers to

obtain information about flights that are relevant to their operations. Subscribers may
include airspace users, including military authorities, ATM providers and aerodrome
service providers such as aircraft maintenance and ground/gate service providers,
general aviation fix-based operators, and other groups such as Customs and
Immigration that may require the data.

9.1.2 Receiving changes on flight information through a Publication Service allows

subscribers to maintain an awareness of changes to flight plan and trajectory
information that will affect flights relevant to them. Such advance information will be
valuable to subscribers for making adjustments to better manage their operations.

9.1.3 An eASP that provides a Publication Service should publish the availability of the

service in its AIP or other appropriate documentation, together with details of the
service provided and conditions concerning access to the service.

**9.2** **SUBSCRIPTIONS**

9.2.1 A Publication Service provides flight plan data using a subscription mechanism:

information on flights that match a set of criteria are transmitted to registered
subscribers in response to certain events or conditions.

9.2.2 An eASP should indicate the events and/or criteria to which a subscriber can

subscribe.

9.2.3 The range and sophistication of subscriptions offered by an eASP will be determined

by the requirements of its potential users. For example, an eASP may need to
subscribe to the flight plans of all flights planned to penetrate an airspace, while an
aerodrome control tower may wish to subscribe to all flights planned to operate
to/from an aerodrome, and an aircraft operator may wish to subscribe to modifications
concerning its flights.

9.2.4 At the simplest, an eASP might offer a choice of subscriptions with fixed filter and data

transmission event criteria. More sophisticated services may allow subscribers to
refine filters (e.g., to select a particular aerodrome or airspace, or to add time periods
of interest) or even to combine filters. For example, an eASP may wish to subscribe to
all flights planned to penetrate an airspace above a certain flight level or which also
departed a specified aerodrome, or both. Increasing flexibility increases the
complexity of the eASP’s systems. However, an eASP may choose to offer tailored
subscriptions to meet specific requirements.

**9.3** **AUTHENTICATION AND CONFIDENTIALITY** 
9.3.1 An eASP should take measures to ensure that subscribers are granted access only to

subscriptions that provide flight data relevant or necessary for their operations.

**9.4** **IMPLEMENTATION**

9.4.1 The Publication Service shall be implemented as a SWIM Information Service.

9.4.2 To allow sharing of flight data efficiently, it is recommended that the Publication

Service use the Publish/Subscribe message exchange pattern with a push
mechanism (see ICAO Doc 10039 section 5.3.2.5.4.1). This reduces the
communication overheads of point-to-point message exchanges and polling. 
## 10 ROUTE AND TRAJECTORY INFORMATION

The following sections describe the different types of trajectories that exist in FF-ICE and
explain their construct. Further guidance, logic rules and examples are provided in Appendix
E-3.

**10.1 ROUTE/TRAJECTORY RELATIONSHIP**

**10.1.1 Types of Route/Trajectory Group**

There are three types of Route/Trajectory Groups supporting FF-ICE, these may be provided
by an eAU to request a service, or be provided by an eASP in response to a service request:

a) Desired – This is provided by an operator when submitting or updating either a

Preliminary or Filed Flight Plan.

b) Negotiating – This is provided by an eASP in response to a Preliminary Flight Plan or

Trial request. It may also be provided by an eASP as a proposed solution when a reevaluation of a Preliminary or Filed Flight Plan results in a Non-Concur or Not
Acceptable status. Constraints and known changes to the route/trajectory group are
included. The negotiating route/trajectory group may also be provided by the eAU
with a Trial request.

c) Agreed – This is provided by an eASP as an indication of the route/trajectory on

record with the eASP. In nominal circumstances it is provided together with a planning
status of Concur, or a filing status of Acceptable. It may however be provided by the
eASP with a planning or filing status of Non-Concur or Not Acceptable thereby
facilitating the operator in determining why the eASP has assessed the
route/trajectory as non-compliant.

An eASP may provide the Desired or Agreed route/trajectory group in a Flight Data Response
to a legitimate Flight Data Request message.

**10.1.2 Combination of route and trajectory information in FF-ICE**

Item 15 of the FPL as described in Appendix 2 of the PANS-ATM (ICAO Doc. 4444) contains
the following data items:

a) Cruising Speed identifying the true air speed for the first or the whole cruising portion

of the flight.

b) Cruising Level identifying the planned cruising level for the first or the whole portion of

the flight.

c) Route as described through a series of sub-items:

1. ATS Route or an indication that the flight to the next point will be outside a
designated route and direct

2. Significant Point

3. Change of speed or level

4. Change of flight rules

5. Cruise Climb

Under FF-ICE the route required for filing a flight plan contains the same mandatory information 
as an FPL, but is modified in format and structure as described in Appendix B. This change to
the format and structure of the data does not alter the phraseology used for the delivery of ATC
clearances, which will still refer to the Item 15 information, so that clearances are provided in
the same manner regardless of whether the flight plan was filed as an eFPL or an FPL.

Optional information items supplement the above data items allowing a trajectory to be
described and/or created to a higher level of fidelity than is possible with the above route items
alone. By providing this higher level of fidelity, the exchange of this additional data allows a
Planning Service to both identify and provide a more accurate assessment of a Preliminary
Flight Plan. The exchange of this additional data during filing allows improved performance of
ATFM and ATC systems.

Figure 19: Relationship of Route to Trajectory

Figure 19 shows how the route can be supplemented with additional data to first expand the
route to include all the significant points defining each ATS Route. This expansion is the
“Expanded Route.” Points may then be added to specify the level and time (not shown) in a
trajectory. At each of these trajectory points, additional data can be provided to describe
local information such as: constraints, winds, or properties of the flight at the point.

The data contained in the route/trajectory group is structured to contain all information above,
as described in Appendix B. The route/trajectory group includes the following classes of
data:

  - Route/Trajectory Initial Cruising data and Estimated Elapsed Time

  - Route/Trajectory Specific Aircraft Performance (provided by eAU only)

  - A sequence of Route/Trajectory Elements

These data classes, together with the operational use for new data items are further detailed
below.

**10.2 ROUTE/TRAJECTORY INITIAL CRUISING DATA AND ESTIMATED ELAPSED TIME**

The route/trajectory group contains the following items:

  - The cruising speed or Mach number applicable to the first or the whole cruising portion
of the flight. This is equivalent to Field 15a in Appendix 3 of the PANS-ATM.

  - The requested cruising level applicable to the first or the whole cruising portion of the
flight. This is equivalent to Field 15b in Appendix 3 of the PANS-ATM. 
  - The total estimated elapsed time of the route/trajectory group. This is equivalent to Field
16b in Appendix 3 of the PANS-ATM.

**10.3 AIRCRAFT PERFORMANCE DATA**

Table 2 describes optional items that may be provided by an operator for the purposes of
providing the eASP with improved trajectory prediction for a variety of ATM functions including
the accurate generation of feedback. The provision of performance data enables an eASP to
calculate a more accurate trajectory when the route/trajectory submitted by the operator is
unacceptable, for whatever reason, or to accurately simulate the impact of potential changes
to the ATM configuration. Not all ASPs will be capable of making operational use of these
optional aircraft performance data items.

It is recognized that an operator would also only provide certain logical combinations of the
data items. These include the following combinations:

1. The operator provides climb and descent speed schedules with an estimated take-off

mass. The eASP may use this information together with the route, speed and level
information to construct a trajectory with climb and descent profiles better reflecting the
individual flight.

2. The operator provides performance climb and descent profiles. The eASP uses this

information, in concert with the route and atmospheric data, to construct a trajectory
with climb and descent profiles representing the individual flight performance.

The information provided may also be used by an operator to construct a more accurate
trajectory for evaluation of modifications to be proposed.

These items can be provided with any of the route/trajectory groups created by the operator.

How each of the above are expressed is described further below.

**10.4.1 Route Items**

The route items include all the items described in Field 15c of the PANS-ATM Appendix 3
together with additional optional data items. These route items are represented as an ordered
sequence of Route Elements (see Figure 20). The Route Elements are sequenced in the order
in which they will be flown from departure to destination. These Route Elements can also be
enriched with additional data such as the trajectory information to form Trajectory Elements.
As a result, the more general term “Route/Trajectory Element” is used to refer to either.

As a trajectory begins at the departure aerodrome and ends at the destination, it follows that
the aerodrome is included within the trajectory data as the first/last route element. As a result,
data concerning the departure/destination appears twice in an eFPL, once within the specific
departure and destination data items and again within the route/trajectory data.

When describing a route, each Route Element contains the items as described in Table 3. Not
all items are required for all Route Elements in the table. Route Elements are associated with
a starting point (Route Element Start Point) and a path (Route to Next Element). The end point
of one Route Element is the starting point of the next Route Element in the ordered sequence.

Additional data provided on a Route Element may apply to either the associated start point or
the path as describe in Table 3. For example, a delay may be taken either at the start point or
along the path. However, a specified change of flight rules occurs at the associated Route
Element Start Point.

A Route Element may include both speed and level changes in addition to constraints on speed
and level. These are equivalent to Field 15c4 in Appendix 3 of the PANS-ATM. The changes
may further indicate whether they are planned to commence or planned to be attained at the
associated starting point. This provides greater flexibility than the FPL message which only
allows a speed or level change that is planned to commence at a point. Guidance on translation
is provided in section 12.

In contrast, constraints are used to indicate that a speed, level or time range or value must be
met at the associated starting point. Constraints are provided as feedback by an eASP allowing
the eAU to better understand the expected flight profile and make an assessment of flight time
and fuel usage.

As illustrated in Figure 21, a constraint may be met through a planned change at any point prior
to the constraint. The constraints are provided by the eASP while planned changes express
how the eAU wishes to operate the flight while meeting any known constraints.

**10.4.2 Expanded Route**

The expanded route takes the route described in 10.4.1 and expands each Route to next
Element into its constituent significant points, explicitly indicating each published point along
that portion of route. The expanded route is also expressed as an ordered sequence of Route
Elements which may contain all of the data elements identified in Table 3. The expanded route
may further include the along route distance as described in Table 4. The along route distance
(ARD) measures the distance along the lateral path prescribed by the expanded route, not the
trajectory. Differences between the distance along the trajectory and the ARD can occur due
to turns (e.g., fly-by and fly-over turns versus instantaneous turns). As described in Table 4,
differences can occur in the starting point for measuring the ARD depending on whether the
Operator or the eASP computed the distance. The starting point is identified as the point at
which the ARD is zero. When a route element is identified as “unspecified”, including for
handling “expect vectors”, the along route distance should express the distance of a direct
segment.

Figure 22 explains how an expanded route is expressed using the sequence of Route
Elements. The airways are expanded to not only include the starting significant points; i.e. S1,
S2, S3, but all the points describing the airway. These additional points; i.e., X1, X2, X3, are
expressed through the route element start point within inserted route elements. The Route to
next Element, in this example the airways, is identified for each Route Element in the expanded
route.  Any additional data, such as level changes or constraints, should be expressed in the
Route Element with a Route Element Start Point at which the additional data (e.g., level change
or constraint) applies. For example, if a level change occurs at X2 the level change should be
expressed as part of the Route Element beginning at X2.

Figure 22: Expanded route example

**10.4.3 Trajectory**

An operator may also provide four-dimensional trajectory information in a flight plan to allow an
eASP to evaluate and provide more precise constraint information. The four-dimensional
trajectory is sent by the eASP to provide detailed constraint information pertinent to a
Preliminary Flight Plan or a Trial request.

Just as the expanded route added more information to the route, the four-dimensional trajectory
further enriches the flight data provided. The Route/Trajectory Element is supplemented with a
four-dimensional point including the optional items described in Table 5. Trajectory information
is expressed as illustrated in Figure 24. Trajectory points; i.e. T1, T2, etc. are added in addition
to points on the route; i.e. S1, X1, etc. This is further described below and is necessary because
the flight does not necessarily operate over the points (e.g., a fly-by waypoint). The trajectory
point allows the information to more precisely reflect the expected location of the flight.
Additional trajectory points may also be added in between points in the expanded route; in this
case, the additional trajectory points may be the starting point of a new Trajectory Element. All
of the information contained in Table 3 and Table 4 may also be included as part of the new
Trajectory Element (see Appendix E-5 reference speed/level changes).

Figure 23 illustrates the case of a fly-by waypoint in which the trajectory is projected to not
precisely overlay the route. The route of flight consists of track-to-point legs between waypoints
S1, S2 and S3. Sampling a predicted trajectory conducting a fly-by of waypoint S2 results in
the trajectory points T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5. When such a trajectory is provided, the fly-by
waypoint is associated with the closest point on the trajectory. In this case, waypoint S2 is
associated with trajectory point T3 during the turn, corresponding to the closest waypoint on
the trajectory intersecting the turn angle bisector. In this case, the along route distance, being
associated with the route in lieu of the trajectory does not represent the distance along the
trajectory. 
Figure 23: Trajectory points not on the route

The trajectory point includes an indication of time which may be expressed as a relative time
or an absolute time. When expressed as a relative time, the time is the elapsed time from an
initial prediction point which is identified using a trajectory point property (see Table 6). In such
a case, the time at the initial prediction point must be expressed using an absolute time.

10.4.3.1 Expressing Points versus a Trajectory

A trajectory point may be used to provide additional data items not found in a route point without
providing a full trajectory. Some examples are described below:

 - A trajectory point may be used by an eASP to identify altitude, speed or time constraints
that are not associated with a point on the route or expanded route. In this case, the
point is identified with a “Constraint Point” trajectory point property together with the
relevant constraint as described in Table 3.

 - A trajectory point may be used by an operator to identify the location and time at which a
flight is predicted to cross into an FIR. This may be used to express the estimated
elapsed time. The point is identified using a trajectory point property of “FIR Boundary
Crossing Point” together with a time at the point.

 - A trajectory point may be used to indicate the location and time at which a flight is
expected to begin an operation at which the flight will remain for some time (e.g., “Begin
Stay” trajectory point property).

In the cases expressed above, the trajectory points may provide insufficient data to infer the
vertical and temporal profile of the flight by interpolating between trajectory points. The lateral
path is also not described by simply joining the trajectory points. This is illustrated in Figure
25.

|Prescribed EET Point|Indicates that the associated trajectory point represents a point that has been prescribed for required Estimated Elapsed Time reporting.

|Airport Reference Location|Indicates that the associated trajectory point is the airport reference location.|Used for expressing the departure or arrival point when specific runway locations on the flight has not been used in the prediction.|2| 
Figure 25: Expressing select trajectory points in lieu of a Trajectory

When these points are provided without providing a more complete Trajectory, the route
trajectory group may not include points with trajectory point properties: “Initial Prediction Point”
and “End Prediction Point.” In such a case, any times at points expressed as relative times
when there is no Initial Prediction Point, must be expressed relative to the take-off time. In
such a manner, the time at the FIR boundary crossing point would be the estimated elapsed
time.

10.4.3.2 Expressing the Vertical and Time Profile

An operator providing a Preliminary Flight Plan may provide:

 - No trajectory information beyond the information required for a Filed Flight Plan (See
Appendix C-4).

 - Aircraft performance data as described in 10.3.

 - An estimate of the flight’s trajectory using the data described in 10.4.3

The eASP providing a response to a Preliminary Flight Plan makes an assessment of
constraints that are applicable to the Preliminary Flight Plan. To do so, the eASP needs to
determine the airspace that a flight is expected to traverse and when by using a predicted
trajectory. In the three cases above, the eASP calculates a trajectory using the best available
information. As more trajectory information is provided by the operator, the prediction is
improved and consistent between operator and eASP.

When a trajectory is exchanged, there is a start and end point to the trajectory prediction.
These points are identified using the Initial Prediction Point and End Prediction Point trajectory
point properties. If a trajectory is provided by the operator, the trajectory should be end-to-end,
starting at the first point and ending at the destination. Trajectories computed and provided by
an eASP may only be described within the eASP’s airspace. In such a case, an initial prediction
point may occur subsequent to departure and an end prediction point prior to a planned arrival.

When a trajectory is provided by the operator, it includes some additional data items in order
to allow an eASP to normalize the assumptions used in building the trajectory. These include
the provision of the following data items with trajectory points:

 - Meteorological Data – This data provides the meteorological (e.g., wind and temperature)
assumptions used when building the trajectory. If the use of the trajectory requires the
application of different assumptions, the information may be used to approximately 
normalize the trajectory. For example, the eASP may have a different forecast of the
winds being used.

 - Assumed Altimeter Setting – It is expected that, for planning purposes, most predictions
will be based on a standard altimeter setting of 1013.2 mbar or 29.92 in. Hg. For cases
outside of this, the assumed setting is provided to allow an altitude correction. Points
with property Transition altitude or Transition Level present allow the determination of the
type of altimeter setting that is relevant to the route portions. Transition altitudes/levels
are not uniform across ANSPs.

A prediction of the Top of Climb and Top of Descent is expressed as a Trajectory Point Property
as well, allowing these points to be identified as such. Providing these points in the trajectory
allows the vertical profile to be described as illustrated in Figure 26.

Figure 26: Expressing trajectory properties for vertical profiles

When a route/trajectory is predicted by an eAU, the starting point or end point of an end-to-end
trajectory may be specified in terms of a Trajectory Point Property including: Start of Take-off
Roll, Wheels off, Departure Runway End, Runway Threshold, Wheels on, End of landing roll
(see Figure 27). These types of departure and arrival points provide clarity on the assumption
used to determine the departure and arrival time of the trajectory. Only one of these types of
points would be expected to be included in the trajectory on departure and one on arrival. This
is useful for the eASP to normalize times when determining constraints that involve flight
interactions. When the specific departure or arrival runway location is not known, a coarse
trajectory may be provided by assuming the departure or arrival point in the trajectory is the
airport reference location. The times associated with such points should be the take-off and
touchdown times. The provision of different options to indicate the departure/arrival time of the
trajectory is intended to facilitate system providers and operators enabling them to select the
one most applicable to their operation.

Note: It is recognized that departure and arrival runways in conjunction with associated SIDs
and STARs may not be known with certainty prior to the flight’s departure. The trajectory point
properties are provided to express the assumptions that are used when constructing the
trajectory. The sharing of forecast airport and airspace configurations by an eASP allows an
operator to make more informed assumptions. 
Figure 27: Expressing trajectory point property for departure and arrival

Time can be expressed as absolute time or relative time. Relative times are linked and can be
used thanks to the initial prediction point associated to an absolute time.

All times should be precise to the second. Note that consecutive points in the trajectory may
have the same time.

10.4.3.3 Expressing Planned Delay

When an operator expresses a planned delay through the delay route element item as
described in Table 3, the corresponding trajectory may also include additional information
regarding the delay.

There are several types of planned delay that can be expressed by a flight:

  - Planned airborne holding

  - Engaging in operations at a point

  - Engaging in operations along a segment

  - Engaging in operations at an aerodrome

  - Engaging in operations within an airspace

Planned airborne holding allows airborne delay to be planned at a specified holding point in the
trajectory. The duration of the hold is expressed through the delay in the route element (see
Table 3). The trajectory point property of “hold entry” and “hold exit” (see Table 6) are used to
identify the points where the trajectory is expected to enter and exit the hold. While planned
airborne holding is a rare occurrence, there may be circumstances in which an operator may
prefer to plan for airborne delay versus taking a pre-departure delay. This data element allows
the Operator, where procedures are in place, to express such a plan as an alternative to taking
an assigned ground delay for flow management purposes.

An operator may wish to operate a flight to a point, engage in operations at that point then
resume IFR operations from that same point; i.e. operations at a point, or from a different point;
i.e. operations along a segment. In this case, the duration of the operation would be expressed
as a delay at the starting point (see Table 3), together with a trajectory point property (see Table
6) indicating the point(s) at which the flight will “Begin Stay” and “End Stay”. These points,
together with the delay times allow the trajectory times to be fully specified through the delay.

A flight wishing to engage in operations at an aerodrome (e.g., touch-and-go practice) may do
so by expressing a delay at a route element start point, where the point represents an 
aerodrome.

When providing a delay together with an associated trajectory point, the time expressed in the
Trajectory Point expresses the time, relative or absolute, at which the flight is expected to first
arrive at the point.

10.4.3.4 Expressing Estimated Elapsed Time

Boundary crossings between FIRs are identified in the trajectory as a Trajectory Point together
with the trajectory point property “FIR Boundary Crossing Point”.  The crossing time is provided
in the Trajectory Point using a relative time from the start of the trajectory, the initial prediction
point. When provided by an operator, the start of the trajectory corresponds to the departure
point. A trajectory point reference can be provided to identify the FIR being crossed into.

10.4.3.5 Expect Vectors

Flights may depart or arrive using a procedure indicating that a flight should “expect vectors”
at some point on the flight path. These are not amenable to providing a trajectory as the path
is unknown. If such a segment is to be expressed in a trajectory, a direct segment should be
inserted between the start and end of the “expect vector” portion of the flight, with times
corresponding to the expected flight time between the points including any vectoring delays
(see Figure 28). The expect vector should be labelled with an additional trajectory point
property as follows:

 - Start of Expect Vectors – Identifies the point in the trajectory at which the flight is
expecting to begin to be vectored as part of a defined procedure.

 - End of Expect Vectors – Identifies the point in the trajectory at which the flight is expecting
to end being vectored as part of a defined procedure.

It is recognized that the above procedures add a higher level of uncertainty. 
Figure 28: Treatment of Expect Vectors Case

10.4.3.6 Expressing Composite Flight Plans

When a flight plan includes a planned change of flight rules between IFR and VFR or VFR to
IFR at an associated route element, that change must be identified through the flight rules for
the associated route element (see Figure 20). A flight beginning as VFR followed by an IFR
segment may begin the computation of the Along Route Distance at either the beginning of the
flight or the start of IFR operations. This point is identified through an ARD = 0. Flights changing
rules from IFR to VFR may compute the along-route distance through VFR route elements.

10.4.3.7 Providing Feedback using the Trajectory

When an eASP constructs an Agreed or Negotiating trajectory and provides it within a
response, the start and end points of the trajectory prediction must be established. This is
accomplished by indicating the initial prediction point and the end prediction point using the sonamed trajectory point properties. Different ASPs may establish the initial prediction point in
different manners. This is necessary as some ASPs may not have sufficient information to
compute the time relative within another ASPs airspace; however, the point must be identified.
The initial prediction point may correspond to a departure time, or to the entry into the FIR
under authority of the eASP. The end prediction point can correspond to either the exit from
the FIR or arrival time. When providing feedback on a trajectory, the eASP modifies the
absolute time at the initial prediction point to ensure time constraints are met.

When an eASP provides feedback incorporating a required re-route on the flight, the portion of
the route that has been modified is expressed using the “Modified Route Indicator” data item
(see Table 3). When points are deleted, the modified route item will indicate both the starting
point at which a route modification begins and the end point at which it terminates as illustrated
in Figure 29.

Feedback may also be provided regarding restricted/reserved or otherwise constrained 
airspace. This occurs by indicating the point on the trajectory corresponding to the entry and
exit from the airspace. The points are labelled with a trajectory point property indicating that the
point is: entry into restricted/reserved airspace, exit from restricted/reserved airspace, crossing
constrained airspace or exit from constrained airspace. Associated with the point, a trajectory
point reference allows the type and name of the constraint to be described. This reference
allows the eASP to provide information on the type (e.g., restricted/reserved airspace, ATFM
program), and identifier of the airspace constraint (e.g., identifier of the airspace
restriction/reservation).

Figure 29: Feedback on a modified route

The eASP can express required altitude, speed or time constraints on the trajectory. These
are expressed using the constraints as described in Table 3. These may be described at either
a route point or trajectory point. This provides a greater level of precision regarding where the
point of application of a constraint may be, compared to indicating the constraint only at a
significant point contained in the route.

Additional constraints applicable at a point along the trajectory may be expressed through the
use of the trajectory point property identifying a constraint point together with a trajectory point
reference. These may indicate trajectory points at which constraints are expected (e.g.,
metering) but for which precise constraints are not yet known when a response to a Preliminary
Flight Plan is provided.

**10.5 UPDATING A ROUTE/TRAJECTORY GROUP**

When a Flight Plan Update is provided, data within the route/trajectory group may be modified
only at certain levels of the route/trajectory group. For example, specifying a change to one
waypoint in the route necessitates updating the full route. Within the route/trajectory group,
updates may be provided of the following data items in their entirety:

 - Aircraft take-off mass

 - Requested cruising speed

 - Requested cruising level

 - Total estimated elapsed time

 - The entire sequence of route/trajectory elements

 - Climb performance profile

 - Descent performance profile 
 - Climb speed schedule

 - Descent speed schedule

When changes to one item impact the value of another, previously provided item, the update
must be provided in such a manner as to result in a consistent route/trajectory group. For
example, if a trajectory has previously been provided, a change to the requested cruising speed
should result in either: an updated sequence of route/trajectory elements with new times, or a
removal of the previously provided route/trajectory elements.

**10.6 RESTRICTION DATA**

In order to enable the operator to compute a trajectory that will satisfy the operational needs of
an ASP to manage its airspace and traffic flows, as well as reflect as closely as possible the
business purpose of the operator, it is important that ASPs publish appropriate restrictions.
These should include:

 - Route restrictions: The closing of ATS routes or parts thereof (either laterally or at specific
levels) for certain city pairs or specific departure and/or destination aerodromes.

 - Level restrictions: Requirements to cross a point in space at/at or above/at or below a
specific level. These requirements should indicate whether they are based on
topographical criteria, due to airspace requirements, or based on inter-facility agreements
and/or traffic flow criteria. Note: These Point restrictions are for planning purposes only.
ATC will be required to issue clearances that allow the operator to meet these Point
Restrictions or waive them. Operators are neither required nor permitted to manoeuvre
without clearance in order to meet planning constraints.

 - Time restrictions: Requirements to cross a point in space at/at or before/at or after a
specific time. These requirements should indicate whether they are in place for ASP
purposes or because of unavailability of facilities outside the control of an ASP (e.g.,
aerodrome operating hours). 
## 11 OTHER NEW DATA ITEMS

**11.1 GENERAL**

11.1.1 FF-ICE facilitates the introduction of additional data items that are not present in the FPL

format as defined in PANS-ATM Appendix 2.

11.1.2 eASPs should publish the types of additional information they use to better assess the

flight plan when it is submitted and/or on an ongoing basis.

**11.2 DANGEROUS GOODS**

11.2.1 The FF-ICE flight plan includes the possibility for the operator to provide additional detail

concerning the carriage of dangerous goods. The information that can be provided is the
same information that is required to be provided to the pilot-in-command via the NOTOC
form, as described in B-2.8.

11.2.2 The information is intended to be used by the appropriate services in case of need,

providing quick reference to the relevant information.

11.2.3 It is anticipated that the dangerous goods information will sometimes be provided as a

late update to the Filed Flight Plan given that the final manifest is often known at short
notice.

**11.3 AIRPORT SLOT**

11.3.1 Airport Slots are used to balance demand against available airport capacity at airports

where the demand exceeds this capacity. The process of allocating airport slots at
coordinated airports is based on the IATA Worldwide Slot Guidelines as a globally
accepted standard.

11.3.2 In some countries it is mandatory for non-scheduled air transport operations or General

Aviation to obtain an airport slot reference and reflect it in the flight plan.

11.3.3 There is therefore a requirement to enable the inclusion of airport slot information, both

departure and arrival slot information, in FF-ICE flight plans as optional data items.

11.3.4 The precise manner in which the data will be used is a decision that will be described in

local rules or regulations.

**11.4 AIRAC DATA** 
11.4.1 A flight plan for a flight that operates close to or over the AIRAC switch period may,

depending upon circumstances, use either set of AIRAC data in computing the flight plan.
The most commonly used reference for determining the AIRAC to be used is the EOBT. If
the EOBT is before 00:00 UTC on the AIRAC date then the ‘old’ data are used and if after
midnight then ‘new’ AIRAC data are used. However, such a fixed reference will never
provide an optimal solution under all circumstances if, for example, the flight departs
shortly before midnight but flies for many hours after midnight using what has then
become ‘old’ data. The reality is that most systems are unable to handle a change to the
reference data mid-trajectory whether during the calculation for planning purposes, during
execution of the flight from an FMS perspective, or while the flight is active in the ATS
systems from an ATM perspective.

11.4.2 The introduction of RNAV terminal procedures has heightened the need for consistent

data to be used. For flights over midnight where a choice of dataset is required this often
places greater emphasis on the need to achieve data consistency for the arrival phase of
flight.

11.4.3 The FF-ICE flight plan allows the operator to indicate, by reference to the AIRAC Effective

Date or cycle, the dataset used in the creation of the flight plan and calculation of the
route/trajectory. 
## 12 TRANSLATION

**12.1 GENERAL PRINCIPLES**

12.1.1 As long as there is a mixed mode in which both ATS messages (as defined in PANS-ATM

Appendices 2 & 3) and FF-ICE messages (as defined in PANS-ATM chapter 17 and
within this document) can be used operationally, the need to be able to map or translate
from one format to the other will exist.

12.1.2 The guidance concerning mixed mode operations, and in particular the expected

responsibilities with respect to supporting a translation capability, are provided in 2.7.

12.1.3 It is a fundamental operational requirement that in such a mixed mode environment the

ability to translate from FF-ICE to ATS message format must be possible, enabling the
necessary flight plan information to be provided to ASPs which have not yet implemented
the ability to use FF-ICE data.

12.1.4 Table 7 provides an indication of the correspondence between FF-ICE messages and

their ATS message equivalents.

12.1.6 New flight information defined for use in FF-ICE that does not correspond to an existing

ATS message field, such as the GUFI or Dangerous Goods information, will not be

12.1.7 Existing flight information containing new data items defined for use in FF-ICE shall be

translated into appropriate Field 18 indicators (e.g. NAV/, SUR/, etc.) as described in 12.2
below. It should however be recognised that since some flight data processing systems
have limitations on the amount of Field 18 information permitted, there may be a loss of
some data in downstream ATS units along the flight path.

**12.2 TRANSLATION GUIDANCE**

12.2.1 This section describes how to construct an ATS message that corresponds with an FF
ICE message.

Notes:

a) When an instruction says to find codes that match those in PANS-ATM (rather than

just copy the codes), it is to allow for the possibility that new codes could be added in
the FF-ICE environment that do not exist in PANS-ATM Appendix 3.

b) For PANS-ATM Field 18 indicators, do not include the indicator if no data are found for it;

i.e. do not include an indicator without any text after it.

c) Message Identifier information is not translated. Fields 3b & 3c of an ATS message are

network specific and therefore have no relevance to an FF-ICE message identifier which
would anyway be of no value to an aASP.

12.2.2 If syntax and semantic checks have been correctly applied upon reception of the flight

plan data, and translation logic correctly described and implemented, then faults during
translation should not normally occur. However, if it happens that a data item cannot be
translated, for whatever reason, the item should be skipped and a fault condition logged
for post-event analysis. The resultant translation may or may not be successful
depending upon the compulsory or optional nature of the data item. A fault encountered
in translation should not alter the flight plan status.

12.2.3 An ATS message can be derived from the associated message per Table 7 by translating

the relevant PANS-ATM fields as follows: 
a) Field 03a- set to “FPL” for a Filed Flight Plan, “DLA” or “CHG” for a Flight Plan
Update (as appropriate), “CNL” for a Flight Cancellation, “DEP” for a Flight
Departure, or “ARR” for a Flight Arrival.

b) Field 07a- set to the Aircraft Identification data item.

c) Field 08a- set to the Flight Rules data item.

d) Field 08b- set to the Type of Flight data item if provided, else omit.

e) Field 09a- set to the sum of the number of aircraft extracted from each Aircraft
Type and Number data if the sum is greater than 1, else leave empty. If the sum of
the number of aircraft is greater than 99 then insert the value 99.

f) Field 09b- if the sum of the number of aircraft (extracted from each Aircraft Type
and Number data) is more than 1 and multiple aircraft types are indicated, or the
single Aircraft Type Designator is identified as non-ICAO, then set to “ZZZZ”.
Otherwise set to the specified ICAO Aircraft Type Designator.

g) Field 09c- set to the Wake Turbulence Category data item.
Note: If local rules do not recognize the category “J”, then alternate procedures
may be required.

h) Field 10a- create the list of codes for Field 10a by finding the Equipment and
Capabilities items that match existing codes in PANS-ATM Appendix 3, Field 10a.
For example, in FIXM the relevant data items include:

i. Flight→Aircraft→Capabilities→CommunicationCapabilities→CommunicationC
apabilityCode

ii. Flight→Aircraft→Capabilities→CommunicationCapabilities→DatalinkCommun
icationCapabilityCode

iii. Flight→Aircraft→Capabilities→NavigationCapabilities→NavigationCapabilityC

ode

iv. Flight→Aircraft→Capabilities→StandardCapabilityIndicator

i) Field 10b- create the list of codes for Field 10b by finding the Equipment and
Capabilities items that match existing codes in PANS-ATM Appendix 3, Field 10b.
For example, in FIXM the relevant data items include:
Flight→Aircraft→Capabilities→SurveillanceCapabilityCode

j) Field 13a- set to the Departure Aerodrome data item if it contains an ICAO
location indicator. Set to “ZZZZ” if Departure Aerodrome data item contains a
name and/or geographical position. Otherwise set to “AFIL”.

k) Field 13b- set to the time of day hours and minutes of the time, using the format
specified in PANS-ATM Appendix 3 (HHMM). The time should be rounded to the
nearest minute if necessary.

i. The time is the Estimated Off Block Time for FPL, CHG, CNL, ARR, RQS and
RQP.

ii. The time is Actual Departure Time for DEP and SPL.

iii. The time is the new Estimated Off Block Time for a DLA. 
l) Field 15a- set to the Requested Cruising Speed data item, converting the format
as necessary.

m) Field 15b- set to the Requested Cruising Level data item, converting the format as
necessary. Set to “VFR” if the Requested Cruising Level indicates “VFR” and the
flight rules indicate the flight will at least begin as a VFR flight.

n) Field 15c- guidance for the creation of Field 15c is provided in Appendix H.

o) Field 16a- set to the Destination Aerodrome data item if it contains an ICAO
location identifier, otherwise set to “ZZZZ”.

## APPENDIX B – FF-ICE Model & Data 

### B-1 Information and Data Exchange Models

B-1.1.1 The data exchange model shall use the data conventions specified in B-2.

The data exchange model shall support the information exchanges described in
APPENDIX C – FF-ICE Messages

### B-2 Data Conventions

**B-2.1** **Vertical Position of Aircraft**

B-2.1.1 The expression of aircraft vertical position shall allow indication of a flight level

or altitude as necessary, consistent with PANS-ATM section 4.10.

B-2.1.2 The expression of a flight level or altitude shall allow indication of meters or

feet.

B-2.1.3 The expression of a flight level or altitude shall support precision appropriate

for the operational use of the information. The vertical position of an aircraft when
expressed within a trajectory should at least allow precision to within 1 meter or 1
foot as applicable.

B-2.1.4 The expression of an altitude shall support referencing to QFE or QNH as

appropriate, and be consistent with PANS-ATM section 4.10.

B-2.1.5 A requested cruising level shall be expressed in even 100 foot increments

when using units of feet.

B-2.1.6 A requested cruising level shall be expressed in even 10 meter increments

when using units of meters.

B-2.1.7 The expression of aircraft vertical position shall allow indication of ‘VFR’ for a

flight operated under VFR flight rules and for which a specific altitude has not been
provided.

**B-2.2** **Position**

B-2.2.1 The expression of a position (or predicted position) shall allow any of the forms

described in PANS-ATM Appendix 3, section 1.6.3.

B-2.2.2 The expression of position as a latitude/longitude should be with respect to the

WGS-84 reference ellipsoid.

B-2.2.3 The expression of a position shall allow varying precision to be used,

appropriate to the operational use of the data. The position of an aircraft when
expressed within a trajectory should at least allow precision to within 1 second of
latitude/longitude or its equivalent.

**B-2.3** **Route Identifier**

B-2.3.1 The expression of a route identifier shall allow for the specification of an ATS

Route, Standard Departure Route, and Standard Arrival Route as described in
Appendices 2 and 3 of PANS-ATM.

B-2.3.2 When a Standard Departure Route or Standard Arrival Route is seven

characters, it should be possible to include both the seven-character name and the
shortened name as described in Annex 11, Appendix 3, paragraph 2.2. A note there
states: 
_Note.— Limitations in the display equipment on board aircraft may require_
_shortening of the basic indicator, if that indicator is a five-letter name-code,_
_e.g. KODAP. The manner in which such an indicator is shortened is left to_
_the discretion of operators._

In practice, the ARINC 424 specification contains an algorithm used to shorten
seven character names. This algorithm results in publication of shortened
names that are used in FMS databases and in some ground automation
systems. Making both names available allows each system to use the
designator consistent with their database. Note also that as automated uplink
of clearances to aircraft is implemented a ground system using the sevencharacter name will need to upload the shorter name for it to load to the FMS
successfully.

**B-2.4** **Aerodrome**

B-2.4.1 The specification of an Aerodrome shall allow use of an appropriate location

identifier per ICAO Doc. 7910.

B-2.4.2 The specification of an Aerodrome shall allow identification of an aerodrome

that has no Doc. 7910 location identifier. For an aerodrome without a Doc. 7910
identifier, the data specification shall allow a name and/or a geographical position
(per B-2.2.2) to be included.

B-2.4.3 A departure aerodrome should allow for identification of a flight that has filed

its flight plan while in the air or for which the departure aerodrome is not known,
beginning its route description from a specified point en-route, and therefore may
not have provided a departure aerodrome.

B-2.4.4 The specification of an Aerodrome shall allow an IATA aerodrome identifier

per the IATA City Code Directory to be included in addition to the ICAO identifier.
(An aerodrome will never be identified only by the IATA identifier.)

**B-2.5** **Aircraft Type and Number**

B-2.5.1 The specification of an aircraft type shall allow expression of a four-character

type designator per ICAO Doc. 8643. Such indicators are two to four alphanumeric
characters, starting with a letter.

B-2.5.2 The specification of an aircraft type shall allow expression of a type that has

no Doc. 8643 identifier, with indication that it is not a standard identifier.

B-2.5.3 The specification of aircraft type shall allow expression of the number of

aircraft for each of the various type designators involved in a formation flight.

B-2.5.4 Number of aircraft shall be represented as a positive integer number.

**B-2.6** **Aircraft Identification**

B-2.6.1 An Aircraft Identification for purposes of communication with Air Traffic

Services shall allow any of the following:

a) The ICAO designator for the aircraft operating agency as defined in ICAO

Doc. 8585 followed by the flight identification (e.g. KLM511, NGA213,
JTR25);

b) The nationality or common mark and registration mark of the aircraft

consistent with Annex 7 (e.g. EIAKO, 4XBCD, N2567GA); or

c) A two to seven character identifier as specified by an ATM Service

Provider. 
B-2.6.2 The specification of an Aircraft Identification shall allow the IATA operator

code and commercial flight identifier to be included in addition to the identifier for
ATS purposes described in B-2.6.1. (An aircraft identification will never be identified
only by the IATA identifier).

**B-2.7** **Flight Rules**

B-2.7.1 A Flight Rules designator shall allow communication of the following types of

flight rules:

a) Intention to operate the entire flight under the IFR;

b) Intention to operate the entire flight under the VFR;

c) Intention to operate initially under the IFR, followed by one or more

subsequent changes of flight rules; or

d) Intention to operate initially under the VFR, followed by one or more

subsequent changes of flight rules.

**B-2.8** **Dangerous Goods Information**

B-2.8.1 Expression of information regarding dangerous goods being carried on a flight

shall support all items defined in the Technical Instructions for the Safe Transport of
Dangerous Goods by Air (ICAO Document 9284), Part 7, section 4.1.1.1.

**B-2.9** **Wake Turbulence Category**

When on an ATS Standard Departure, or Standard Arrival Route, a route
identifier as described in the appropriate section of B-2.3 is included.

**B-3.3** **Requested Change**

B-3.3.1 A Requested Change indicates Operator intent to change altitude, speed,

and/or flight rules at the start point of a Route/Trajectory Element. Each
Route/Trajectory Element may contain a requested change; which may specify
speed, level, and/or flight rules.

b) the type of constraint (at, at or before, at or after, or between 2 times).

**B-3.5** **Trajectory Point**

B-3.5.1 A Trajectory Point may be specified as the start point of a Route/Trajectory

Element. Note that a Trajectory Point may be specified along with a Route Element
Start Point, in which case it is the Trajectory Point associated with the start of a
Route Element or Expanded Route Element. If specified without a Route Element
Start Point then it is for a Trajectory Element that is along a route Element but does
not begin at the start of the Route Element.

B-3.5.2 **Geographic Position — The position on the earth, expressed as a**

latitude/longitude per B-2.2.

B-3.5.3 **Time — The predicted time at the Trajectory Point, expressed as a duration**

loiter; i.e. the flight will interrupt its progression along the route at the associated
point and expect to request resumption of its progression along the filed route after
the indicated duration. 
B-3.6.2 A Planned Delay may be associated with a specified route point, meaning that

the delay starts and ends at that point.

B-3.6.3 A Planned Delay may be associated with a specified route Element, meaning

that the delay starts at the beginning of the Element and ends at the end of the
Element.

should Aircraft Performance Data be required.

**B-3.7.2** **Performance Profile**

B-3.7.3 Aircraft performance data can be provided in the form of a zero-wind, standard

atmosphere profile reflective of the flight capabilities and desired
parameters. Separate profiles should be provided for climb and descent. The
profile should not include any flight-specific constraints such as altitude or speed
restrictions applicable to the route of flight. Constraints that are always applicable
(e.g., a 250 knot constraint applicable to all flights below 10,000 feet), and gradients
required for obstacle clearance along the route of flight should be incorporated into
the profile.

B-3.7.4 A performance profile is expressed as a sequence of profile points each

containing: distance, time duration, flight level or altitude, and optionally the true
airspeed.

B-3.7.5 Climb profiles begin at take-off with distance and time expressed relative to

the point associated with take-off, nominally the “Wheels Off” point. Climb profiles
end at the maximum operational cruise altitude for the specific route/trajectory.

B-3.7.6 Descent profiles begin at a top-of-descent at the maximum operational cruise

altitude for the specific route/trajectory. Time and distance are expressed relative to
the top-of-descent. Descent profiles end at touchdown.

**B-3.7.7** **Speed Schedule**

B-3.7.8 A climb and descent speed schedule may be provided as input for more

accurate trajectory construction. Each speed schedule is comprised of a target
Indicated Airspeed and, if applicable, Mach Number representing speed targets for
the flight in transition assuming no flight-specific constraints. 
## APPENDIX C – FF-ICE Messages

The tables in this section detail the required and allowed data elements for each of the
FF-ICE messages identified in the PANS-ATM, paragraph 17.3.

Note that the designator “message” is used in the general sense of a communication
between two parties. The implementation of that communication could be through various
means, for example web services or publish/subscribe. It is also possible that the content
of what are described as two separate messages could be packaged into one
communication. For example, a Submission Response and Planning Status might
together form the basis of a web services response. (While later Planning Status updates
could be delivered via another mechanism such as Publish/Subscribe).

These tables only show the data elements that must or can be included in specific types
of exchanges.

Note that some of the data items are compound, most notably the Route/Trajectory. There
will naturally be additional layers of logic to capture conditional data requirements, e.g. if
a Trajectory Point is included then certain attributes and connected elements may be
required always and others required conditionally. Any such rules that are universal will
be captured in APPENDIX E – Logic Rules as global logic rules.

Data items identified in “Message Information” are information that should be made
available to the application that processes the message; however some of the data
elements could logically be implemented within the communications infrastructure, e.g. a
header—analogous to the AFTN header described in Annex 10. For example, the list of
relevant ANSPs for an existing flight may be obtained from existing data, possibly obtained
via the communications infrastructure, and therefore does not need to be repeated in
subsequent messages for that flight. Because a communications infrastructure has not
been specified, only general data items can be defined at this time.

Some data items may be included more than once. The following limits should be
observed:

a) **Alternate Destination Aerodrome: Up to 2 alternate destination aerodromes**

may be specified.

b) **Alternate Take-Off Aerodrome: Up to 2 alternate take-off aerodromes may be**

specified.

c) **Alternate En-Route Aerodrome: Up to 20 alternate en-route aerodromes may**

be specified.

_1 The processing result is the discretion of the eASP. The result for one eASP may not be the_

_2 a) The modification causes a change to the trajectory anticipated by the eASP while remaining_

_b)_ _The modification may represent an opportunity for improvement. The negotiate response_
_and associated negotiating route/trajectory is therefore a proposal which may improve the_

_3  An Agreed trajectory in Filing with an Acceptable status may indicate a difference compared to_

_the trajectory previously existing as reference. The difference however should not impact the_
_ATC clearance, such as a change to the en-route lateral (2D) route/trajectory, unless local_
_agreements allow the assignment of a route by the eASP._

_4 An Agreed trajectory in Planning should not indicate a modification to the trajectory, this would_

_be a Negotiate response. It may however indicate the removal of references to a_
_restriction/constraint which has been cancelled or no longer applies to the flight. This would be_
_similar to the scenario described in Note 2b but without making a proposal for change._

_5 An Agreed trajectory can be provided with a Not Acceptable response. It provides the_

_trajectory as determined by the eASP with an indication of the reason(s) for it being assessed_
_as non-compliant. It therefore provides the operator with an improved ability to understand the_

## APPENDIX E – Logic Rules

Note: This section provides some initial rules for consideration. Validation and
demonstration activities and continued analysis should identify additional rules that should
be checked.

### E-1. Introduction

Rules for the content of data items in a message sometimes depend on relationships to
other data items. These rules can take the form of required presence, e.g. if element ‘A’
is included then element ‘B’ must also be included, or can take the form that there is a
relationship between the values, e.g. for an element ‘A’ with cardinality 0..n, the value
associated with a specific sub-element (e.g. A.B—could be time, distance or some other
numeric value) must be greater than the previous one.

### E-2. Performance Based Navigation

Each PBN capability depends on certain navigational capabilities. When a PBN capability
is based on a navigational capability, that navigational capability must also be present.
The required relationships are shown in Table 22 below.

Table 22 PBN and Navigation Dependencies

**PBN Capability** **Required** **PBN Capability** **Required**

If any of the Navigation Capabilities (S, O, D, I, G, C) are changed then the dependencies
should be re-checked.

### E-3. Route/Trajectory

A Route/Trajectory is distinguished by the type of route provided, and the type of trajectory
information provided.

The route may be either: 
1. **A Route. In a Route, each significant point and route element that would be**

present in an FPL field 15c has a corresponding route/trajectory element; or

2. **An Expanded Route. An expanded route contains every significant point that is in**

the route. While a Route has only the entry and exit point from each ATS route
traversed, the expanded route contains each significant point traversed along each
ATS route.

Additional trajectory points included may be either:

A. **None (no additional trajectory points included);**
B. **Selected trajectory points. These are points that correspond to an event listed in**

Table 6, Trajectory Point Properties. ATM Service providers and Operators should
work to identify the properties that will contribute to consistent modelling of
trajectories between the parties; i.e. only a small set of properties, and their
associated points, may be needed to achieve acceptable consistency.

i. Example 1: Estimated Elapsed Time points (e.g. FIR boundary crossings) are

specified as a separate list in the legacy ATS message but are better
integrated with the route by inclusion as trajectory points.

ii.Example 2: Inclusion of selected significant dynamics changes such as start

of climb/start of descent/top of climb can allow a recipient to model a
trajectory more consistent with user expectations.

C. **A complete trajectory contains trajectory information that includes every turn;**

every start and completion of cruising level; and every change in airspeed. A
complete trajectory must also contain each required EET point. Additional points
may be added to achieve needed accuracy, the following is the minimum required
to call a trajectory complete.

i. Every significant point in the route;

ii. Start and completion of each change in cruising level; and

iii. Start and completion of each change in airspeed.

Different packages can be defined by the route option (1 or 2 above) and the trajectory
option (A, B, or C above). For example:

1. **Package 1A (Route and no trajectory points) shall be supported by all eASPs, to**

allow for easy initial transition by operators—they can repackage their existing
route information into an FF-ICE flight plan.

2. **Package 1B (Route with selected trajectory points) might similarly be useful in**

early implementations; an eASP can continue using their existing trajectory model,
modified only to use specific defined points (e.g. top of climb, top of descent) to
calibrate their model with the user provided data.

a. Selected trajectory points in package 1B should include at a minimum

required EET points as trajectory points in lieu of a separate list of EET
points. Additional points are optional and based on understanding of what
data relevant eASPs can take advantage of to synchronise trajectories.

3. Note that the idea of a **Package 1C is invalid, since all turn points must be**

represented for a trajectory to be complete, meaning that all the significant points
in an expanded route are required.

4. **Package 2A could allow a recipient to process a route end to end (or simply**

beyond their current scope), even if they do not have full aeronautical data.

5. **Package 2B would allow end to end processing, and facilitate consistency of**

trajectories as in 1B.

6. **Package 2C can be used if the eASP can use the end-to-end trajectory provided**

by the operator (or can extract the portion relevant to their airspace). 
While an operator can provide any of the packages listed, and an eASP must be able to
accept any of them, an eASP may process data only from certain packages. For example,
an initial implementation may process only Package 1A. The eASP must identify which
data they will process, and work with regional users so that expectations are aligned with
regard to what information will be helpful to provide, and avoid operators spending money
to provide data that isn’t used by the eASPs.

**E-3.1.** **Content of a Route**

When specifying a Route, the information content should include at least what is present
in Field 15c of an FPL. The required content only includes the information that is required
in the FPL today. Several optional elements are also identified which could enhance
processing of the route, but they should not be required (particularly in initial
implementations). A Route will include a series of Route Elements, included in the order
in which they will be flown and with the following characteristics:

a) The first Route Element of a Route[7] must include at a minimum the following:

a. Route Element Start Point= Departure aerodrome

b. Route to Next Element= The SID to be flown; or indication of direct route

b) Each subsequent Route Element (except the last one) must have at a minimum

the following:

a. Route Element Start Point= a significant point in the route (as would appear

in a Field 15c and consistent with PANS-ATM Appendix 3 section 1.6.3);

b. Route to Next Element= the ATS route (or the STAR) the flight will be on

after crossing the Route Element Start Point; or indication of Direct route;
or indication of Unspecified following a delay point; and

c. Optionally, each Route Element Start point can include the geographic

location of the associated significant point or aerodrome. This can be used
_by a recipient to disambiguate a named significant point, since the same_
_name is often used for multiple waypoints or NAVAIDs throughout the_
_world._

c) The last Route Element should contain:

a. Route Element Start Point= the destination aerodrome; and

b. No Route to Next Element.

**E-3.2.** **Content of an Expanded Route**

An Expanded Route will include a series of Route Elements included in the order in which

7 A route to be exchanged that starts at other than the departure aerodrome must follow the rules
outlined in E-3.5 
they will be flown and with the following characteristics:

a) The first Route Element[8] should include

a. Route Element Start Point= Departure aerodrome

b. Route to Next Element= The SID to be flown; or indication of direct route

c. The geographic location of the departure aerodrome should be included

for the Route Element Start Point.

b) Each subsequent Route Element should have

a. Route Element Start Point= the next significant point in the route. (Even if

it is a point being traversed on the same ATS route, SID, or STAR as the
previous route element);

b. Route to Next Element= the ATS route (or the STAR) the flight will be on

after crossing the Route Element Start Point; or indication of Direct route;
or indication of Unspecified following a delay point; and
_Note that in an expanded route, there may be a number of sequential_
_elements all with the same Route to Next Element;_

c. The geographic location of the associated significant point must be

included for the Route Element Start Point, and

d. The along-route distance of the Route Element Start Point should be

included.

c) The last Route Element should contain:

a. Route Element Start Point= the destination aerodrome;

b. No Route to Next Element, and

c. The along-route distance for the Destination Aerodrome should be

included.

**E-3.3.** **Content of Selected Trajectory Points**

Selected trajectory points to include should be driven by information published by relevant
eASPs (as part of the service description, see guidance in 2.10.1 and 2.10.2). There is no
reason to include data that the eASPs cannot make use of.

When selected trajectory points are provided with a Route, each Route/Trajectory Element
must have an along-route distance (ARD) included so that the exact relative location of
points can be established. The ARD starts at 0 at the Route/Trajectory Element Start Point.

8 A route to be exchanged that starts at other than the departure aerodrome must follow the rules
outlined in E-3.5 
Any trajectory point not directly along the route (e.g. if trajectory accurately models a flyby
turn) need to be projected onto the route to provide the Along Route Distance of that point.
See section 10.4.3 and Figure 23 for more on turn modelling.

_Remember that when only a Route is provided, there may be several unelaborated turn_
_points along the ATS route identified for a segment. When a subsequent included_
_trajectory point is somewhere along that ATS route it will not be clear between which two_
_points along the route it falls. Including the ARD of the trajectory point will make the_
_position clear when the route is expanded, by comparing the ARD to the ARD of each_
_expanded significant point._

When selected trajectory points are provided with an Expanded Route, each trajectory
point can be placed unambiguously between two significant points, i.e. ARD is not
important for placing them.

A summary of the data included with each trajectory point is in the Table 23 below. Full
descriptions of the data items can be found in Table 4 and Table 5.

When trajectory points are provided, the time of the initial prediction point must be an
absolute time, and the time at any subsequent points must be relative times. It should be
noted that when the initial prediction point is the departure aerodrome the associated
absolute time is the airborne time, not the EOBT.

Table 23 Data associated with a Trajectory Point

**Data Item** **Required?**

Along Route Distance (ARD) The Route Element associated with a trajectory point

must include an ARD. This is especially important
when selected trajectory points are included in a Route,
as the ARD will allow the recipient to properly order the
trajectory point between significant route points. Note
that while the ARD may be provided for the Route
element start points as well, it is not required since the
recipient can calculate those ARDs.

Geographical Position Every trajectory point must include a geographical
position. The geographical position may lie directly
along the route of flight, or may not - for example a
precise turn model can be reflected - but in any case
the trajectory point position must be within required
conformance bounds.

Time Every trajectory point must include the predicted time at
that point.

Level A trajectory point must include the predicted level at that
point.

Assumed Altimeter Setting A trajectory point may optionally include an altimeter
setting used by the trajectory modeller for barometric
altitude determination at that point.

|Data Item|Required?|
|---|---|
|Along Route Distance (ARD)|The Route Element associated with a trajectory point must include an ARD. This is especially important when selected trajectory points are included in a Route, as the ARD will allow the recipient to properly order the trajectory point between significant route points. Note that while the ARD may be provided for the Route element start points as well, it is not required since the recipient can calculate those ARDs.|
|Geographical Position|Every trajectory point must include a geographical position. The geographical position may lie directly along the route of flight, or may not - for example a precise turn model can be reflected - but in any case the trajectory point position must be within required conformance bounds.|
|Time|Every trajectory point must include the predicted time at that point.|
|Level|A trajectory point must include the predicted level at that point.|
|Assumed Altimeter Setting|A trajectory point may optionally include an altimeter setting used by the trajectory modeller for barometric altitude determination at that point.| 
|Data Item|Required?|
|---|---|
|Predicted Airspeed|A trajectory point may optionally include the predicted IAS or Mach Number at that point.|
|Predicted Ground speed|A trajectory point may optionally include the predicted ground speed at that point.|
|Wind Vector|A trajectory point may optionally include the predicted wind vector at that point.|
|Temperature|A trajectory point may optionally include the predicted temperature at that point.|
|Trajectory Point Property|A trajectory point must include applicable trajectory point property(ies) that describe the event that occurs at that point. Trajectory point properties to be included should be worked out with eASPs to ensure all properties needed are provided, and operators do not spend significantly to provide properties that will not be used.|


**E-3.4.** **Content of a Complete Trajectory**

As described above, a complete trajectory will have a certain minimum number of points
included—which is every significant point in the expanded route and every altitude cruising
level and airspeed change; and all required EET points. This is the minimum content to be
called a “complete trajectory”, additional points for other events described by Trajectory
Point Properties may also be included where accuracy needs warrant.

The actual data included for each point in a complete trajectory is as shown in Table 23
above.

**E-3.5.** **Special Case: Route/Trajectory begins at a point en-route (not at departure**
**point)**

It could be possible that there is a need to share a partial route—one that has had the
portion of the route prior to a certain point tailored out (removed). This is also needed to
service a flight that has filed its flight plan while in the air or for which the departure
aerodrome is not known. To do this there should be agreement on how to represent such
a case.

1. The first Route Element Start Point must be the significant point where the tailored

route begins. (In a full route, the Route always starts at the departure aerodrome.)

2. The first Route Element Start Point must have an associated Trajectory Point,

indicated as the Initial Prediction Point, with an absolute time, indicating when the
flight will be at that start point. The Trajectory Point must also have an associated
level, since the trajectory at this point will typically not be at ground level but either
at or transitioning to the expected cruising level.

3. The remainder of the Route/Trajectory will follow the rules as for a full

route/trajectory. 
**E-3.6.** **Partial Route/Trajectory**

The route/trajectory provided by an eASP in a Planning or Filing Status response will
typically include only the portion of flight within its area of interest. Therefore, for an eASP
located along the route of flight; i.e. not the departure or arrival eASP, the route prior to
entry into its area of interest and subsequent to leaving its area of interest will not be
included. In such a case:

1. The first route element start point will be the significant point where the tailored

route begins; i.e. the point of entry into the area of interest of the eASP.

2. The first route element start point must have an associated Trajectory Point,

indicated as the Initial Prediction Point, with an absolute time, indicating when the
flight is estimated to be at that start point.

3. The Along Route Distance of the first element start point will indicate the estimated

distance to that point from the departure aerodrome.

4. The route/trajectory within the area of interest will follow the rules as for a full

route/trajectory.

5. The last route element start point will be the exit point from the area of interest.

The route element will contain the Route Truncation Indicator. It may also have an
associated Trajectory Point indicating it as the Final Prediction Point.

_Notes:_

_1. The geographic points, altitude, and time are shown in a display format and don’t_

_necessarily match any model representation such as FIXM._

_2. A trajectory modeller may insert points to represent changes in dynamics, e.g. wind effects_

_on ground speed. The set of Trajectory Point Properties do not describe every possible_
_case, so there may be a trajectory point with no TPP._

_3. The trajectory in this table follows the route of flight precisely, so the significant point and_

_trajectory point geographic locations match exactly._

_4. A trajectory point with no associated significant point will still show an Along Route_

_Distance. This must be the projection of the trajectory point geographic position onto the_
_relevant route segment. This projection should be perpendicular to the trajectory._ 
_5. Points 3, 9, and 10 are examples of additional trajectory points to increase accuracy._
_6. The example uses the airport reference location as the Start/End Prediction Points_

_however, if known, the specific departure or arrival runway locations should be included_
_using the appropriate point property (Wheels Off, Wheels On, Start of Take-Off Roll, etc.)_
_as precise trajectory start/end points._

### E-4. Aircraft Data

The wake turbulence category specified for the aircraft should be consistent with the
category(ies) associated with the aircraft type designator in ICAO Doc. 8643.

Two different flight plans with overlapping departure/arrival times should not have the
same Registration or Aircraft Address.

_Note 1: SELCAL codes are not unique to an airframe and so may be duplicated._

_Note 2: In the case of an equipment swap, two flight plans may temporarily have the same_
_aircraft data. Since this occurrence is inevitable, a check to reject entry of identical aircraft_
_data in two different overlapping flights is not possible. However, a system could flag both_
_flights so that neither may be cleared until the situation is resolved._

### E-5. Requested Changes to Speed & Cruising Level

The FF-ICE trajectory allows a change of speed/level to be indicated at a trajectory point,
as opposed to a published point. However, if provided on a trajectory point, then any need
to provide the route description in Field 15 format, either within a FPL or for presentation
to a person, will require a translation or transposition of the requested speed/level change
such that it appears at a published point.
For the purposes of translation, local procedures may dictate at which point a change in
speed/level is to be specified when the change is not planned at a published point. In this
case some basic rules should be applied to ensure the route description and the trajectory
are consistent.

Referring to Figure 32, the requested speed/level change may be indicated as a
‘Commence’ at the trajectory point T1 or at one of the published points P1 or P2. It should
not be indicated prior to P1 or after P2. Similarly, the change may be indicated as an
‘Attain’ at the trajectory point T2 or at one of the points P3 or P4. It should not be indicated
prior to P3 or after P4.

Figure 32: Example Speed/Level Change

It is recommended that requested speed/level changes should continue to be indicated at
published points while the trajectory should indicate the precise trajectory points where
the climb/descent is actually expected to begin/end. This means that a requested change
may be shown twice: once as the requested RFL change tied to a significant point; and
once as a trajectory point property showing the actual locations of the vertical change in
the trajectory. An example is provided in Table 27.

The requested cruising level should be consistent with the assignable levels appropriate
for the flight rules and airspace concerned. This will normally be a concern for the
departure facility, as any different rules for later airspace would be accounted for by
changes in clearance en-route.

When a requested cruising level is within airspace where specific capabilities or approvals
are required, such as Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum (RVSM) airspace, the flight
plan should also indicate the appropriate capability/approval or an indication that it has
requested special handling; i.e. requests non-RVSM operation in RVSM airspace, if
applicable. A flight requesting such a level without the appropriate capability, approval or
request for special handling should be dealt with proactively, either by rejection of the flight
plan or by flagging the flight for special attention by Air Traffic personnel.  
## APPENDIX F – Association Checks

### F-1. General

All flight data processing systems will use an algorithm to determine to which flight plan a
received message should be associated. Similarly, if the received message is a complete
flight plan, it will be determined whether or not the same flight plan already exists.

This process of flight plan association is typically performed using several ‘key’ fields such as
Aircraft Identification (Callsign), Departure Aerodrome, Estimated Off-Block date and time and
perhaps the Destination Aerodrome. The eFPL has introduced the GUFI as a unique identifier
of the flight plan, assuming only one flight plan per flight is permitted.

It therefore follows that it should be sufficient to use only the GUFI for association purposes.
In a stable, fully automated and well tested environment exclusive use of the GUFI may be
feasible. However, during early implementation of FF-ICE and its flight planning procedures,
including correct allocation by the operator of the GUFI and its use by eASPs, it is considered
unwise to rely exclusively upon the GUFI.

It is therefore recommended that the GUFI should initially be used as an additional key-field,
helping to identify the correct flight plan in cases of multiple association, where the normal
association algorithm has identified more than one matching flight plan.

On reception of an eFPL it is recommended that checks are performed to ensure the same
GUFI doesn’t already exist in the database for a different flight or the same flight doesn’t
already exist but with a different GUFI.

In determining ‘same flight’ it is important that ASPs have the same or at least similar
association logic so that if one ASP along the route of flight considers two flight plans to be
for the same flight, other ASPs will come to the same conclusion.

### F-2. Association Logic

The process to determine if a received flight plan (with a unique GUFI) is in fact the same as
an existing one (even with a different GUFI) requires a comparison of the key-fields, primarily
the aircraft identification, departure airport and time but may also include the destination
airport (see Table 28). Determination of ‘same aircraft identification’ and ‘same departure
airport’ probably doesn’t require further explanation. ‘Same time’ is less obvious. How far apart
in time do two flight plans with the same aircraft identification and same departure airport have
to be before they can be accepted as two different flights? The algorithm presented below is
based on the principle that an FPDS will not want to have two flights with the same aircraft
identification within its area of interest at the same time.

It is recommended that association between two flight plans should occur when the two main
key-fields (aircraft identification (callsign) and departure airport) match, and where the flying
period of the two flights overlap. The flying period is defined as follows:

a) where the departure airport and the destination airports are different: 
Off-block date and time[9] plus twice the total estimated elapsed time or 20hrs
whichever is less;

b) where the departure and destination are the same:

Off-block date and time plus the total estimated elapsed time or 6hrs whichever is
less.

Note: the parameters (20hrs & 6hrs) mentioned above may need adapting depending
upon the size of the area of interest.

Table 28 “Same Flight” Logic

**Aircraft ID** **Departure** **Destination** **Flying** **Conclusion**
**period**

Different       -       -       - Different flight

Same Different     -     - Different flight

Same Same Different No Overlap Different flight

Same Same Different Overlaps Same flight

Same Same Same No Overlap Different flight

Same Same Same Overlaps Same flight

The process to determine that a received flight plan or Flight Plan Update does not match
with existing data despite having matching GUFIs requires a relatively simple comparison of
the key-fields. If the key-fields don’t match, then there is something wrong. See Table 29.
Note that an update always contains the key-fields as they were before the proposed change,
so that translation to an ATS message (e.g. CHG or DLA) is possible.

- some flexibility may be employed in determining whether or not two EOBTs match. For example, if
the two values differ by 29 min or less (the current requirement to indicate a delay to the EOBT has a
threshold of 30min) they may be considered as the same. Where ATFM procedures are applied the
threshold may be less, typically 14 minutes. 
## APPENDIX G – GUFI Construction

### G-1. Composition of the Namespace for a GUFI

The GUFI namespace is used to identify the originator of a GUFI. The GUFI originator is not
necessarily the flight plan or message originator, although usually they would be the same
entity. For example, it is possible that an independent GUFI creation service could be used
by flight plan originators that do not wish to create their own GUFIs. The namespace
associated with these GUFIs would be that of the creation service and would have no
connection to the flight plan originator.

It is important to recognize these namespaces are simply a method to select a unique identifier
for the originator of the GUFI, and they are not intended to represent information about the
flight itself. The GUFI namespace should not be used as operational information about the
flight.

After GUFI generation and its assignment to the flight, the GUFI must not change, even if the
original source for the namespace content is changed in some way. Additionally, it is the intent
that the GUFI originator should use a single consistent namespace when possible to allow
uniqueness to be testable for the organisation.

The Table 31 provides the recommended namespace constructs. Each originator should
choose the most suitable option. 
An operating agency can be identified by its three letter Operating Agency Designator (ICAO Doc. 8585).

An ATM unit can be identified by its corresponding four letter Location Indicator (LOCID as determined
in ICAO Doc. 7910). A LOCID is available for each FIR or ACC, as well as for airport locations that
operators are tied into. For example, the ATM unit “Washington ATC Center”, LOCID KZDC, assuming
just one system generates GUFIs, might use the following namespace “KZDC”.

An organisation can be identified from the registered specific internet Fully Qualified Domain Name
(FQDN) of its organisation. The domain name can come from either the organisation’s email, or from
the organisation’s website. The domain name used should uniquely identify the organisation.

Example Fully Qualified Domain Name:
For website https://www.example.com/ and email person@example.com, the domain name used for the
namespace would be “example.com”

Use of subdomains:
The namespace can additionally utilize subdomains as needed to ensure proper uniqueness and allow
for best implementation. This could be done by adding a numeric or regional subdomain.(i.e.
east.example.com, region1.example.com, etc.)

|1|Operating Agency Designator|An operating agency can be identified by its three letter Operating Agency Designator (ICAO Doc. 8585).|
|2|Four letter Location Indicator (LOCID)|An ATM unit can be identified by its corresponding four letter Location Indicator (LOCID as determined in ICAO Doc. 7910). A LOCID is available for each FIR or ACC, as well as for airport locations that operators are tied into. For example, the ATM unit “Washington ATC Center”, LOCID KZDC, assuming just one system generates GUFIs, might use the following namespace “KZDC”.|
|3|Fully Qualified Domain Name|An organisation can be identified from the registered specific internet Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of its organisation. The domain name can come from either the organisation’s email, or from the organisation’s website. The domain name used should uniquely identify the organisation. Example Fully Qualified Domain Name: For website https://www.example.com/ and email person@example.com, the domain name used for the namespace would be “example.com” Use of subdomains: The namespace can additionally utilize subdomains as needed to ensure proper uniqueness and allow for best implementation. This could be done by adding a numeric or regional subdomain.(i.e. east.example.com, region1.example.com, etc.)| 
## APPENDIX H – Route/Trajectory Translation

### H-1 Data Structure

 H-1.1 Route/Trajectory Element

A route/trajectory element is described in Appendix B.3 and contains the following items. A
route/trajectory is composed of a series of Route/Trajectory elements. All data items in the
translation algorithm reference items in B.3, Figure 30: Route/Trajectory Group.

### H-1.2 Data Items Needed for Translation Algorithm

Note that the information that is not relevant to a Field 15c route can be eliminated. That is:

  - Along Route Distance

  - Modified Route Indicator

  - Route/Trajectory Constraint; and

  - Trajectory Point

  - Planned Delay

Thus, the data structure of interest is then:

### H-1.3 Additional Data Definitions

Additional definitions used in the algorithm:

A significant point is a Route Element Start Point that has been inserted into the translated
route field.

A geographic point is a **significant point that:**

a) Is represented by a geographic position (i.e. Latitude/Longitude); or
b) Is represented by a bearing and distance from a designated point.

### H-2 Assumptions

The FF-ICE Route/Trajectory data definition allows for a great deal of flexibility in terms of
how the data items might be populated. In developing the algorithm it was found that
translation could be compromised unless certain conventions are followed. Such
requirements are listed here:

|Table 33 Route/Trajectory Data Items Used in Translation|Col2|Col3|
|---|---|---|
|Route/Trajectory Element|||
||Route Truncation Indicator (B-3.2.4)||
||Route Element Start Point (B-3.2.5)|Position|
|||Geographic Position|
|||Aerodrome|
||Route to Next Element (B-3.2.6)|ATS Route or ‘Direct’ or ‘Unspecified’|
||Requested Change (B-3.3)|Cruising Level Change|
|||Cruising Speed Change|
|||Cruise Climb|
|||Change of Flight Rules| 
A. Every Route/Trajectory Element will have the Route To Next Element populated

except for the final point in the route, which may be the destination or may be the final
point in a truncated route. This means that a trajectory point should show the route
segment it is part of.

     - If this convention is followed, the check as to whether a point is on the same
route segment as the previous point is simplified.

B. When recording a change in speed or level, both the speed and level applicable at

the point will be included.

     - The legacy format always shows both speed and level for a requested change
at a significant point. Translation is simplified if the FF-ICE route/element
includes both.

C. There will be exactly one Route/Trajectory element associated with the Departure

Aerodrome, and one associated with the Destination Aerodrome, unless truncated or
an air-file flight plan. The Route Element Start Point in each case is the Aerodrome
Location Indicator, and an optional associated Trajectory Point can contain a point
property, e.g. wheels off, and the appropriate location.

The algorithm assumes it will encounter only one point associated with the departure and
destination.

### H-3 Route Translation Algorithm

This algorithm translates an FF-ICE route/trajectory into an ATS Message Field 15c as
documented in PANS-ATM Appendix 3.

The algorithm references data items in the Table 33 above. Referenced data items are shown
in blue or bolded text as described.

For each Route/Trajectory Element:

See guidance in Appendix E-5 if the Route Element is to be skipped but has an associated Requested Change (of any type).|If a trajectory point is included that is not at a significant point on the route; then there will be no Route Element Start Point. Trajectory points are not included in a legacy FPL and therefore are immaterial to route translation. Destination Aerodromes are not part of the Field 15c, therefore should not be included in the route translation.| 
Any significant point that is part of a direct route
segment must be in the translated route.

Any significant point that indicates a route
change from one ATS route to another must be in
the translated route.

Any significant point that is the first point in the
route for air-filed flight plans must be in the
translated route. Points not passing this rule will
be points along an ATS route with no change in
route at that point; and no requested change at
that point.

Note that the departure aerodromes will never
pass this rule.

Each inserted significant point may have
associated information prepended or appended
per the items in PANS-ATM Field 15c.

These rules govern inserting that information,
which is based on the Requested Change element
in the FF-ICE Flight Plan.

|For each Route Element perform the following steps:|Explanation of each step|
|---|---|

Any significant point that is part of a direct route segment must be in the translated route. Any significant point that indicates a route change from one ATS route to another must be in the translated route. Any significant point that is the first point in the route for air-filed flight plans must be in the translated route. Points not passing this rule will be points along an ATS route with no change in route at that point; and no requested change at that point. Note that the departure aerodromes will never pass this rule.|
|3. If the Route Element Start Point inserted in step 2 included Requested Change information, then modify the inserted Significant Point as follows: 3.1. Cruise Climb: Prepend to the characters “C/” and append the relevant altitudes consistent with PANS-ATM Appendix 3 Field 15c6; 3.2. Speed and Level Change: Append the speed and altitude consistent with PANS-ATM Appendix 3 Field 15c4; 3.3. Flight Rules Change: Append the characters “IFR” or “VFR” as indicated in the change, consistent with PANS-ATM Appendix 3 Field 15c5.|Each inserted significant point may have associated information prepended or appended per the items in PANS-ATM Field 15c.

Appendix I  Implementation Strategy Manual on FF-ICE

## APPENDIX I – FF-ICE Implementation Strategy

### I-1. Introduction

I-1.1. Background

I-1.1.1. The Flight and Flow Information for a Collaborative Environment (FF-ICE) concept will be

the catalyst to bring about a step change in global air traffic management (ATM) towards
ICAO’s vision of an integrated, harmonised and globally interoperable ATM system.

I-1.1.2. FF-ICE flight plans and flight information sharing capabilities are built on the concept

components and guided by principles laid down in the ICAO Global ATM Operational
Concept (GATMOC, Doc 9854). Given its scalable nature, FF-ICE will be the de facto
mechanism upon which global aviation will utilise for flight planning and related functions
as ATM evolves, enabling future ATM concepts such as trajectory based operations
(TBO).

I-1.1.3. Taking into consideration the lessons learnt during the transition towards the current ICAO

flight plan format, hereinafter referred to as “FPL 2012”, in 2012, this document aims to
lay down a strategy to guide ICAO Member States and regions in planning the
implementation of FF-ICE to reduce any potential challenges arising from mixed mode
operations, as well as to ensure a smooth, harmonised global transition to FF-ICE.

I-1.2. Role of FF-ICE in future ATM

I-1.2.1. FF-ICE, supported by a System Wide Information Management (SWIM) environment, acts

as an enabler for many of the features identified in the GATMOC. Flight information
exchange using FF-ICE will improve ATM stakeholders’ decision-making process at both
the individual and at the network level. Globally harmonised procedures in ATM planning
using FF-ICE will enable seamless and collaborative decision-making among ATM actors,
bringing about overall increase in system wide ATM efficiency.

I-1.2.2. The FF-ICE planning service and earlier submission of flight plan with trajectory

information enables ASPs to more accurately forecast traffic demand, analyse traffic
patterns and adjust traffic flow management plans and measures. Through negotiation
mechanisms, ASPs and AUs work collaboratively to achieve optimal efficiencies for ATM
systems and flight operations, taking into account varying airspace scenarios and AU
preferences.

I-1.3. Benefits of FF-ICE

I-1.3.1. The first release of FF-ICE (FF-ICE/R1) will help to overcome many limitations of FPL

2012, allowing ASPs to optimise their resources and AUs to fly closer to their preferred
trajectories. For example, FF-ICE allows for a flexible information set which can
accommodate extensive information needs, such as trajectory data, facilitating
collaborative decision making by allowing ASPs to balance their demand against capacity
more accurately and facilitating AUs’ adherence to their preferred trajectories as much as
possible. By minimally implementing the FF-ICE filing service, both ASPs and AUs will be 
Appendix I  Implementation Strategy Manual on FF-ICE

able to share more detailed trajectory information and perform negotiations based on
known constraints, thus offering opportunities to optimise flight operations earlier and more
accurately. The use of SWIM technology with globally harmonised rules will allow
consistent sharing of information to all relevant stakeholders in an efficient, accurate and
timely manner.

I-1.3.2. In addition to access to more information, FF-ICE/R1 introduces a new planning service

which allows for the submission of flight intent in advance (potentially up to a year or more,
depending on what is reasonably accurate and practicable). AUs will be able to notify
ASPs of their flight intent while ASPs will be able to feedback on the restrictions and
associated constraints applicable to that flight, hence allowing a collaborative and iterative
planning process to optimise the flight plan for AUs. With the early availability of flight
planning information, ASPs will also enjoy the flexibility to plan their resources such as
airspace organisation and availability, and staffing allocation accordingly. Requirements
for the advanced submission of flight plan information will be balanced against the need
to ensure reliability of information; more detailed information would only be supplied closer
to the day of operations.

I-1.3.3. FF-ICE/R1 also brings about another value adding service in the trial service. The trial

service allows an AU to test out alternative trajectories without committing to them; with
this, AUs will be able to assess the feasibility of alternative trajectories before submitting
a change to their preliminary or filed flight plans. The trial service ensures stability and
relevance of information held within the main ATM system since trial flight plans are not
considered for ATM planning by ASPs.

I-1.3.4. Subsequently, future releases of FF-ICE would support dynamic post-departure trajectory

negotiations between AUs and relevant ASPs in real time, as well as among ASPs and/or
other relevant stakeholders. The sharing and management of flight trajectory information
via FF-ICE during all phases of flight facilitates TBO, a step towards achieving the ATM
vision as described in GATMOC.

### I-2. Key Considerations for FF-ICE Implementation

I-2.1. The less than desirable experience in the ‘hard’ cutover from the previous ICAO flight plan

to the ICAO FPL2012 taught us that a better approach should be considered in phasing in
FF-ICE. Anecdotally, for the transition to FPL2012, while States and ANSPs were given
lead time to prepare for the cutover, changing of their flight planning systems was not
straightforward as some were strongly tied to their main ATC automation and processing
system which required even longer lead time to prepare. Even for the ANSPs whose
systems were ready to accept the FPL2012, the operational benefits that were supposed to
have been brought about by the changes introduced in the FPL2012 might not have been
fully realised as not all flight planning and/or ATC systems in the world were able to fully
harness and automate the flight planning processes to reap the intended benefits of
FPL2012.

I-2.2. To avoid the undesirable effects of the FPL2012 implementation, it may be worthwhile to

consider the issues from the perspectives of key stakeholders and potential users of FFICE. Broadly, two issues that might potentially hinder the acceptance of FF-ICE –
unavailability of FF-ICE provisions and guidance materials; and the perceived notion that
FF-ICE remains theoretical as there is no working example. For the former, to date a
significant amount of FF-ICE related provisions and guidance materials have been 
Appendix I  Implementation Strategy Manual on FF-ICE

developed or refined. Once ready, they will provide the necessary references from which
stakeholders can take guidance to ensure harmonised understanding and standardised
implementation globally. Equally important is the need to have some working systems to
demonstrate the feasibility of FF-ICE, and to make apparent the positive opportunities
offered by FF-ICE. While not everyone may choose to implement FF-ICE at the onset, it is
conceivable that small group(s) of likeminded ATM actors can work together to implement
FF-ICE early. As time progresses, others would take the reference cases for their own
assessment and may find FF-ICE to be operationally beneficial. Likewise, for the industry,
prospective vendors of related products should be on board to readily offer solutions that
will support AUs and ASPs in their decision to implement FF-ICE.

I-2.3. Other than the above, there are considerations which have to be taken into account for FF
ICE implementation to be seamless worldwide. The following sections discuss these in
greater detail.

I-2.4. FF-ICE Availability

I-2.4.1. Provisions – to support the transition to FF-ICE, ICAO had been working on the FF-ICE

Concept Document and Implementation Guidance (Doc 9965), as well as consequential
amendments to ICAO Annexes and Procedures for Air Navigation Services (PANS) which
would be required by FF-ICE. The first installation of the FF-ICE provisions, i.e. FFICE/R1, would focus on the pre-departure planning and negotiation procedures between
the ASPs and AUs. This is expected to be made applicable by 2024.

I-2.4.2. The implementation of FF-ICE/R1 would allow AUs and ASPs to file and process flight

plans using FF-ICE processes. Future package would focus on the flight execution phase
and would be able to broaden the exchange, management and use of flight information
throughout the lifecycle of a flight in such a manner as to enable TBO.

I-2.4.3. Minimum Capability – in FF-ICE/R1, there are a total of six FF-ICE services, structured

and designed to be implemented independently. The implementation of Filing Service and
Flight Data Request Service could replace the current FPL2012 flight planning services,
and would be sufficient to support the end of FPL2012. The other four services (i.e.
Planning Service, Trial Service, Publication Service and Notification Service) could be
implemented independently and incrementally depending on needs of the ASPs and AUs.
The incremental implementation would ease transition challenges and lower the risks of
operational and system issues.

I-2.4.4. Translation – it is likely that vendors will create translators to allow an ASP to accept a

FF-ICE flight plan without changing their underlying system, and to allow an AU to
generate a flight plan which would be sent in a FF-ICE format. While such translators may
allow an earlier and quicker transition to an FF-ICE environment, the underlying operations
remain unchanged and hence, would not reflect the full benefits of FF-ICE.

I-2.4.5. In addition, while translation works in the interim as some may use it to bring forward FF
ICE implementation, it is not ideal. Implementing FF-ICE using translators would run the
risk of limited support for information exchange and management in subsequent
operations (especially beyond FF-ICE/R1), such as in the processing of trajectory data
which could potentially result in data loss or misrepresentation of flight intent which might
lead to safety implications if information gaps are not satisfactorily mitigated. Instead of 
Appendix I  Implementation Strategy Manual on FF-ICE

translators, ASPs and AUs are encouraged to look ahead and, recognising the full benefits
of FF-ICE, work towards a more reliable and operationally sustainable solution.

I-2.4.6. Systems Availability Timelines – for customised systems, ASPs and AUs would need

to schedule changes and/or upgrades to support FF-ICE implementation. A cost/benefits
case would need to be investigated by the ASPs and AUs in order to determine the need
for any near-term or off-cycle upgrades to their systems. Such analysis of the ASP or AU’s
unique cost/benefits position would then dictate when and what level of FF-ICE would be
implemented.

I-2.4.7. For vendor-provided commercial systems, ASPs and AUs would need to be aware of the

readiness timeline for various FF-ICE capabilities and services in order to align these
changes and upgrades to their FF-ICE implementation plans. If benefits do not justify an
off-cycle upgrade, the system user will likely acquire FF-ICE capability at the time of the
next upgrade of their system when the vendor has made FF-ICE compatibility part of the
standard offering.

I-2.5. SWIM Availability

I-2.5.1. It is strongly encouraged that FF-ICE/R1 be implemented via SWIM solutions. However,

to implement FF-ICE on SWIM, AUs must have confidence that such communications
capability would be available where they primarily operate. For ASPs, they would want to
know that AUs in their airspace and the ASPs with whom data is being exchanged with
have access to the applicable SWIM services.

I-2.6. Phased Implementation Considerations

I-2.6.1. Mixed Environment Considerations – ASPs and AUs could adopt a phased approach

to transition to FF-ICE in accordance to their needs and the reasonable availability of
relevant systems. However, such an approach would mean that a mixed mode
environment where ASPs and AUs use both FF-ICE flight plan and FPL2012 at the same
time, would likely persist for a period of time. This may lead to confusion amongst the ATM
community, potentially resulting in AUs filing wrong flight plan formats to ASPs of different
capabilities (some are FF-ICE capable, some are not). Consequently, flight planning
process could be perceived as more cumbersome than before as AUs have to refile or go
through additional processes, thus discouraging them and others to transit to FF-ICE fully.
Actions should thus be taken to ensure that the transition from a mixed environment to
FF-ICE is as seamless as possible, as such, the expected benefits can be achieved earlier
in order to increase the adoption rate of FF-ICE.

I-2.6.2. Foreseeably, mixed mode operations may persist for a long period of time depending on

the rate of adoption of FF-ICE. At the initial stage when FF-ICE is introduced, it can be
expected that ASPs and AUs may still want to be able to stay as close as possible to
current processes for flight planning and filing. For example, AUs may want to continue
filing FPL2012 flight plans while operating through airspace managed by an ASP that has
already transitioned to FF-ICE. Conversely, ASPs that have yet to transition would want
to be able to continue managing all flights using their existing flight planning system.
However, prolonged mixed mode operations would be undesirable if processes are not
optimised and additional resources are incurred to support both modes of flight planning,
which would impede the take-up rate of FF-ICE and possibly negate FF-ICE benefits.
Additionally, clear communications would be required to ensure that FF-ICE capabilities 
Appendix I  Implementation Strategy Manual on FF-ICE

of ASPs and AUs are made known to other ASPs and/or AUs to prevent complications
due to filing of wrong flight plan formats.

I-2.6.3. The use of translators in the implementation of FF-ICE/R1 would mean that full trajectory

information may not be available to either the ASP or AU (see para 2.4.5). Transition to
FF-ICE should thus consider the downstream impact of FF-ICE/R1 implementation
decisions. As there may be varying degrees of FF-ICE implementation (see Figure 33),
the levels of FF-ICE capabilities and corresponding services provided by all ASPs, as well
as the data fields that are available for request, need to be specified clearly in the
aeronautical information publication to facilitate proper flight planning processes and
ensure consistency in expectations. If not managed carefully, the complexity of flight plan
processing systems can reach an unmanageable level that can lead to erroneous flight
plans shared by different parties, impacting ATM.

Figure 33 – Varying Degrees of FF-ICE Implementation

I-2.6.4. Incremental Implementation Considerations – FF-ICE had been designed to be

introduced and implemented based on national and regional needs and timelines, but in a
standardised manner. The minimum service requirement for implementation would be
Filing Service and Flight Data Request Service, which will be sufficient to retire FPL2012
globally. It therefore indicates that the sooner these minimum capabilities are implemented
globally, the earlier the sunset date of FPL2012 can be. Subsequent implementation of
additional FF-ICE services such as Planning or Trial Services could be decided separately, 
Appendix I  Implementation Strategy Manual on FF-ICE

depending on national and/or regional needs. This incremental approach will ease the
transition to FF-ICE and lower operational risks.

I-2.6.5. By taking the first step of accepting FF-ICE flight plans through the filing service, ASPs

would gain access to more detailed trajectory information. This would be useful for
strategic traffic flow management purposes, at the same time allowing ASPs to
explore/develop other capabilities made possible by the additional trajectory information.
ASPs will be able to gain experience in using the trajectory information and hence better
build up their system capabilities for information processing, readying themselves for the
provision of additional FF-ICE services incrementally.

I-2.6.6. A global transition plan would seem necessary to take into consideration the potential

different stages of FF-ICE implementation across the regions in order to improve
interoperability.

I-2.7. System Integration and Contingency Planning

I-2.7.1. Whether a standalone FF-ICE system had been developed, or with the use of

converters/translators in the interim, consideration for its connectivity with other systems
and associated contingency plans should be factored in, especially during the transition
period where interim systems are used. Should the standalone FF-ICE system or the
converter of a particular FF-ICE unit fail, especially during the initial deployment period,
relevant contingency plans would need to be effected to revert to the use and transmission
of FPL2012 flight plans in a mixed mode environment seamlessly.

I-2.8. Transition and Training

I-2.8.1. The traditional way of processing and handling of flight plans would be vastly different

under the FF-ICE concept. For FF-ICE/R1, relevant personnel (such as flight dispatches
of AUs or personnel of ASPs performing as little manual intervention as possible) who
needs to understand how FF-ICE services work is equally important as the powerful
automation tools and systems set up. Additionally, while FF-ICE/R1 had been designed
with automated flight plan processing as far as practicable, there could still be instances
when manual, human-machine interactions would be necessary. It is therefore essential
for the relevant personnel to be trained on the automation of such FF-ICE/R1 services
which would also enable them to attain deeper understanding and greater appreciation of
the various FF-ICE services and associated processes.

I-2.8.2. Sufficient time would have to be catered for this significant operational change, including

having suitable change management practices to be put in place. In a similar manner, for
subsequent releases of FF-ICE, time would need to be allocated for such transition and
training activities to be completed.

I-2.9. Moving in Alignment with the Global Air Navigation Plan (GANP)

I-2.9.1. The economic, safety, and operational benefits of FF-ICE would vary for different ASPs

and AUs, depending on the characteristics of their operations and the features that had
been planned to be implemented. All participants should be able to recognise and
experience the immediate benefit of moving to a more capable and superior form of
information exchange (in FF-ICE) in an XML-based format instead of the FPL2012, even
if the participants may not yet require the feedback and negotiation features of FF-ICE. 
Appendix I  Implementation Strategy Manual on FF-ICE

ASPs and AUs that can appreciate and plan to make the best of the FF-ICE features, such
as in the negotiation of flight trajectories, would be encouraged to adopt and implement
these services early to kickstart the process and provide a positive demonstration for the
rest of the world (see para I-3.2.4).

### I-3. Approach to FF-ICE Implementation

I-3.1. Global Strategy

I-3.1.1. Early engagements – ICAO plays an important role in leading a global change in ATM.

To work towards the wide adoption of the FF-ICE concept and FF-ICE/R1 services, ICAO
could play a leading role in spearheading awareness campaigns, technical briefings and
workshops. These would serve to introduce the main features of FF-ICE/R1 and its
benefits, the need for change in support of future ATM, and to communicate ICAO’s
transition strategy towards FF-ICE and the aim of eventually retiring FPL 2012 in ICAO
flight planning provisions. Such campaigns and briefings should reach out to a large
audience of ASPs and AUs to allow the understanding and appreciation of FF-ICE/R1.

I-3.1.2. Similarly, technical symposiums would also be held for the industry to understand the

changes expected for various FF-ICE/R1 services, so that the systems and their relevant
features could be developed accordingly and be made available. Ideally, such
symposiums should involve ASPs and AUs to facilitate discussions between the system
vendors and their users, which also serves to bring in ASPs and AUs’ earlier in their
involvement in the design and development of systems by the industry. This can also be
viewed as a form of risk mitigation as it facilitates the timely incorporation and integration
of FF-ICE/R1 capable systems into the respective ASPs’ ATM systems to minimise
processing errors.

I-3.1.3. Ideally, such campaigns, workshops and briefings should be carried out from now till 2024,

i.e. the applicability date of FF-ICE/R1 provisions.

I-3.1.4. Ending Support to FPL 2012 Flight Planning Procedures – while a phased approach

would be adopted for the transition to FF-ICE, it is envisaged that there will be an end date
when mixed environment operations would cease. Sufficient time ought to be provided to
ASPs and AUs to effect the transition to have the minimum services of FF-ICE/R1
implemented (i.e. the implementation of Filing Services and Flight Data Request Service).
To support this, once FF-ICE/R1 is ready and its application has begun, all future
amendments to ICAO FPL 2012 provisions will no longer be accepted except for
amendments required to ensure aviation safety. The sunsetting of FPL2012 will therefore
be expected (see Section 4 for more details). Once past the agreed sunset date, ICAO
would stop supporting all amendments to provisions related to ICAO FPL 2012.

I-3.1.5. Minimal FF-ICE/R1 Capabilities by System Design – to facilitate early implementation

of minimum services of FF-ICE/R1, ASPs and AUs could use translators. However, use
of such nominal capability limits the experience of the benefits that FF-ICE/R1 can bring
about, and could work against the move towards full FF-ICE implementation. Vendors
should therefore consider the inclusion of other additional capabilities to enable users to
experience the full suite of FF-ICE benefits, providing a more favourable and attractive
proposition for stakeholders to consider implementing more of the FF-ICE services.
Notwithstanding, it is recognised that operational need varies from region to region.
Provision of commercially available system capabilities should therefore be made 
Appendix I  Implementation Strategy Manual on FF-ICE

available in a flexible fashion, such as in the form of scalable modules depending on
varying needs. This would then reduce the barrier to entry and implementation inertia for
many, paving the way for more to get on board.

I-3.2. Regional Strategy

I-3.2.1. Need for Regional Implementation/Transition Plan – ATM is transboundary in nature.

A regionally harmonised approach to FF-ICE implementation would be necessary to
maximise benefits to all ATM stakeholders. Ubiquitous information sharing using FFICE/R1 services in ATM networks would enable advanced planning, better allocation of
resources, increased trajectory predictability and more, all leading to improved ATM
system capacity and flight efficiency.

I-3.2.2. While it will be ideal to have all ASPs in a region commit to and embark on FF-ICE

implementation, and transition at the same time, it is not realistic. As needs and
capabilities differ from one to another, a coordinated approach to transition would be more
palatable overall. Time and again, as demonstrated across different regions in the past, it
can be an effective strategy to have groups of likeminded ASPs and stakeholders come
together to start on an initiative, thus encouraging others join in later. Regional
implementation plans should be developed to take that into account, laying down
incremental steps for States’ planned transition to FF-ICE/R1. As this may take place over
several years, regions should also develop a tracking mechanism to allow States to reflect
their implementation progress of FF-ICE/R1 as the region progresses towards seamless
ATM through enhanced flight planning.

I-3.2.3. To facilitate harmonised and coordinated implementation of FF-ICE/R1, regions should

consider identifying the sub-regions or groups and set transition dates based on these
groups’ readiness. In setting transition dates, the sub-regions / groups would need to take
into consideration the system development plans of the respective ASPs in the group. As
ATC system upgrade typically occurs once every 10-15 years, a long lead time would thus
be required by ASPs to allow phasing in of FF-ICE/R1 requirements in subsequent system
upgrades. Nonetheless, implementation of FF-ICE/R1 at the minimal level may be
achievable without incurring significant changes to the core ATC system.

I-3.2.4. In-depth regional engagements and demonstrations – regional engagements could

start even before FF-ICE/R1 provisions are applicable (i.e. before end 2024). Unlike global
engagements, the regional engagements should have more in-depth and practical
discussions, workshops and demonstrations where States, ASPs, AUs, industry and all
other relevant stakeholders would be strongly encouraged to lead or participate actively.
Such discussions, done at the regional level, will allow for a better assessment of the
benefits for the region. More table-top exercises, demonstrations and trials should be held
especially for ASPs and AUs that wish to gain experience in FF-ICE before implementing.
The demonstrations and trials could be planned and incorporated into regional
implementation and transition plans, to facilitate groups of ASPs to work together closely
and move from trials to implementation in a coordinated manner.

I-3.2.5. ICAO regional task forces could also be set up to provide guidance at the demonstrations

and trials and to keep track of progress at the regional levels. Engagements between the
task forces between regions would be required to ensure harmonised implementation
across neighbouring regions. 
Appendix I  Implementation Strategy Manual on FF-ICE

I-3.2.6. Within a region, sunset dates for FPL 2012 provisions could also be determined for a more

harmonised transition towards FF-ICE/R1 implementation.

### I-4. FPL 2012 Sunset Dates

I-4.1.1. It would be unrealistic to assume that, as traffic grows, the global ATM system can

continue to support both new additional requirements as well as legacy ones. Rather, it
should be recognised and decided at an earlier stage that appropriate efforts and
resources can be better channelled in a more pragmatic way to accelerate the
advancement of FF-ICE which is beneficial to global ATM in the long run.

I-4.1.2. Once ICAO began familiarising the regions, industry and other stakeholders on the FF
ICE concept, needs and requirements from now till 2024, and when FF-ICE provisions,
concept document and implementation guidance are finalised and made applicable by end
2024, regions could start to develop implementation and transition plans which should
include workshops, table-top exercises, demonstrations and/or trials.

I-4.1.3. At the same time as regions develop their plans, States, ASPs and the industry may work

concurrently on specifying and finalising their respective system requirements to
incorporate FF-ICE capabilities. Following which, prototypes or even developed systems
could be made available for use in the planned table-top exercises, demonstrations and/or
trials.

I-4.1.4. It is estimated that it would take about three years for States and stakeholders to be

familiar and gain confidence in FF-ICE. By the end of 2027, States would have had
sufficient lead time to gain the necessary experience and be able to formulate their plans
for implementing FF-ICE.

I-4.1.5. In line with the timelines mentioned above and for the purpose of channelling focus

towards FF-ICE implementation across all regions, ICAO will cease amendments to
provisions concerning the FPL 2012 by the end of 2027. To align States on a harmonised
transition plan and to minimise duration of mixed mode operations, all regions should
consider setting a sunset date for FPL 2012 by end of 2032. Regions are strongly
encouraged to incorporate this sunset date into their regional air navigation plans. The
global sunset date for FPL2012 that is considered within the present implementation
strategy is 2034. Please refer to Figure 34 for an overview of the transition strategy to FFICE and the indicative timelines. Review of the timelines will be conducted to consider the
transitions made by regions and to adjust the global sunset date for FPL2012 where
necessary.

I-4.1.6. To reap the full benefits of FF-ICE and to step closer towards the vision of the GATMOC,

all States should be encouraged to implement FF-ICE beyond the minimum level. To
optimise the use of resources and to advance ATM developments, regions and States
should also consider reviewing the requirements of other FPL 2012 related services, and
to consider planning the cessation of these services once FF-ICE and other supporting
means are in place.
